         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF Mr. Hieron, &amp;c.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Mr. <hi>Hieron's</hi> Parentage, Birth, and Childhood.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>John Hieron</hi> was a Prophet, and the Son of a Prophet. His Father was Miniſter at <hi>Stapenhil</hi> near <hi>Burton</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> a Vicaridge it was, and in that Vicaridge-Houſe he was born in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1608, and baptized the 28th day of that Moneth. His Father being puritanically inclined, had no great things in the World; but he was a good Man. I have heard his Son <hi>John</hi> ſay of him, that he was well eſteemed of by Mr. <hi>Hilderſam</hi> and his Hearers: And that he did believe that he was found in the way of Righteouſneſs. It hath been the ſin, and the ſhame of this Nation, Oh when ſhall we be cleanſed! that the leaſt ſcandalous Miniſters have been forced to take up with moſt ſcandalous maintenance. They then made ſure to make Old Nonconformiſts poor, and to keep them ſo: But through frugality, and Gods Bleſſing they lived, and brought up their Children well. Since the Year 1662 they have uſed a Method quite to ſtarve Nonconformiſts. Not a poor Vicaridge, not a blind Chappel, not a School, nor any viſible way of maintenance for them, and yet they have lived. Providence is kind
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100845:4"/>
and tender! handfuls of Meal are growing, and we almoſt think we may ſome of us live to ſee Puritaniſm better thought of, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for in <hi>England.</hi> I know many Nonconformiſts pinched, but none ſtarved. Though neither Purſe nor Scrip, yet no inſupportable tempting wants: When Bladders are pricked, yet they can't ſink whom God will hold up by the chin, and teach the hand of Faith, the true ſwimming ſtroak.</p>
               <p>In his minority he went over <hi>Trent,</hi> both going to, and coming from School, and was once or twice endangered thereby. In a Note found under his own hand, it is thus ſaid:</p>
               <list>
                  <head>Deliverances to me vouchſafed, <hi>à teneris annis.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <item>1. From a Cow in his Fathers yard, that took him on her horns, and threw him a great way, yet without any harm.</item>
                  <item>2. Falling out of a Chamber into a dry Fat in the lower room, yet no harm.</item>
                  <item>3. Fell out of a Boat into <hi>Trent,</hi> yet not hurt.</item>
                  <item>4. Once ventring into the <hi>Trent-boat</hi> himſelf, and not being able to manage it, and the wind high, he was carried down the River towards ſome deep place, and at leaſt one whirlepit, where he had been in danger to have been loſt: But one ſeeing it, took a private Boat, and ſtopped him, and his drowning was prevented.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe he recounts, and adds a good note, The Lord expects we keep a chronology of remarkable things done by him for us. <hi>Greenhil</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 2. In theſe things we may note, That theſe preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were preſages of ſomething more than ordinary, that God had for him to do. Where ſuch notable things occur, they ſignifie ſome eminent Evil the Perſons are reſerved for, or ſome eminent good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for. <hi>Moſes</hi> drawn out of the Water was a deliverer. There is a paſſage in the minority of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> That there was a ſwarm of Bees ſetled on his Face in his Cradle, and flew away without any hurt to him: Whereupon his Father utter'd this ſaying, <hi>Si vixerit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantulus iſte, aliquid magni erit,</hi> If this Child live, he will be ſome great Man. Again, ſince you ſee he laid theſe in his Records, kept them as the <hi>Pot of Manna,</hi> let us rehearſe and record Gods goodneſs. It's a real wonder any Child lives to be a Man, or if they do, they are not all <hi>Mephiboſheths,</hi> through folly. It muſt be aſcribed to God and his Providence, without which all our Watchers and Keepers would be in vain. There are many places that give us occaſion to call them as <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 16. 13, 14. did the Well <hi>Beer-la-hai-roi,</hi> places where
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100845:4"/>
we have found God ſeeing for us, and looking after us, where we have not looked at him, nor for him.</p>

               <p>HE went to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and was admitted into <hi>Chriſt's Colledge, May</hi> 2. 1625. under the Tuition of Mr. <hi>William Chappel,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Roſs</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for whom he had an high veneration to the day of his death, and never mentioned him without honour, as being a Learned, Painful, Careful Tutor, and very faithful to his Truſt, and conſtant Expounder of Scripture in his Chamber at Night when his Pupils came to Prayer, ſhewing them the Logick of their Bibles; which Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> alwayes accounted very advantageous and beneficial. On the Lords-days Sermons were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and an account taken of his Pupils, how they ſpent that day.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100845:5"/>
And if any of them walked diſorderly, and perſiſted under Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he would acquaint their Friends, and ſend them home; reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to keep none, who anſwered not the ends of their being ſent thither. In this Colledge he was choſen Schollar of the Houſe, and in the Colledge he continued, without ever abſenting himſelf (except once three Weeks) until <hi>Jan.</hi> 1628, when he commenced <hi>Bachelour of Arts.</hi> About <hi>March</hi> 25th. following he went to <hi>Dis</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to teach School. The profits of the place he found might have been conſiderable, but ſome other things not ſo well ſuiting: At the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement he returned to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and continued in the Colledge until <hi>September,</hi> when he went into <hi>York-ſhire</hi> to an Acquaintance of his Tutors Mr. <hi>Thurſcroſſe,</hi> a Prebendary of <hi>York.</hi> At which place, called <hi>Kirkby-Moor-ſide,</hi> he had his Table in Mr. <hi>Thurſcroſs</hi>'s Houſe, and ſome other ſmall matters, Reading Prayers for him, and teaching School in the Town.</p>
               <p>Thus that Colledge, famous for Worthy Men of old, and of late Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hen. More,</hi> received no ſmall honour from Mr. <hi>John Hieron,</hi> an honourer of his Colledge and Tutor, and an honour to them. He brought from thence Gold and Ivory; but no Apes and Peacocks; ſolid, no uſeleſs Learning.</p>

               <p>BEing devoted by his Parents to God, and Educated for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and God having given him an heart to improve the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of his Education into a preparation for that great tremendous work; he was willing to conſecrate and dedicate himſelf, and deſiring that good work, he (a lover of Order and ſenſible that no adviſed Man dare take that honour to himſelf) did addreſs himſelf to Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> a Learned Man, then Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> who upon Examination found his worth; which he readily did, about Baptiſmal Regeneration, which he ſo ſtrongly argued out of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Service-Book, that the Biſhop was put to his diſtinctions, ſhewed himſelf much pleaſed with him, and wiſhed he had known him ſooner, that ſo he might have beſtowed on him ſomething that he had lately diſpoſed to another. His Ordination proceeded, and on Trinity-Sunday 1630, he was ordained both Deacon and Presbyter. Thus this good Man entred regularly, put his hand to the Plough, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100845:5"/>
looked back. This his Ordination he was well ſatisfied in, and ſo well, that when ſome (run into Errors) would ſpeak of renouncing it, he did with much abhorrency reject ſuch a motion. And yet on the other hand, he was far from thinking Ordination by Presbyters invalid, or a nullity either in the Reformed Churches, or in <hi>England.</hi> His Acquaintance were moſt of them Presbyterians, and he ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them as the Miniſters of Chriſt: He needed no Reordination becauſe he had Epiſcopal. He never open'd his mouth to encourage any of his Brethren to ſeek Reordination, which Laws (made as hard as uncharitableneſs could make them) required of the Presbyterians.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Thurſcroſſe</hi> was very deſirous of his ſtay, and gave him ſome proſpect of preferment by or from him, yet that place being at ſo great a diſtance from his Father, he would not bear his ſtay there, but after he had continued about a year and half, called him home to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. His next place was <hi>Eggington,</hi> where he was Houſhold Chaplain to Sir <hi>H. Leigh,</hi> and did preach at <hi>Newton-Sulney,</hi> which was very near him, where Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was to procure a Miniſter, for which he had his Table, and the keeping of an Horſe, and Ten pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was a diſcurſive Man, and ſometimes detained this ſtudious Man too long at Dinner, who yet a little againſt his temper concealed his uneaſineſs, and wrote thus in his Almanack againſt the day of his coming to <hi>Eggington, Acceſſus ad Proſopopaeiam, Apr. 29th.</hi> 1631. By which he meant he muſt now perſonate ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, and not act like himſelf, nor follow his own <hi>Genius.</hi> He was not for meals to be devourers of time, nor converſe to ſwallow up ſtudy. His Study was his Paradiſe, and the ſwallowing of Books his moſt delightful Meat and Drink. Sometimes when long ſitting at Table was wearyſom to him, he took the liberty to leave them, and to walk into the Garden, or to go into his Chamber. Sir <hi>Henry</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued him much, and was ready to teſtifie it; and now 1632, his time of Commencing <hi>Maſter in Arts</hi> being come, he went to take his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> by Intereſt procured him a Buck, to be ſent to

And Sir <hi>Simon Every</hi> (who marryed Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s Daughter) gave him ſomething towards his Charges. Upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he was ſought to by the good Lady <hi>Heyrick,</hi> to whom he went and paid his reſpects, but would not leave Sir <hi>Henry</hi> (though he had the offer of a double Salary) who was a noble generous ſpirited Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and had obliged Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> by manifold Conveniences, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him much liberty, and all the reſpect that might be. About this time <hi>Catharine</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> a Religious Lady of Noble Extraction ſent to him to preach her a Fryday Lecture (though I think the Counteſs kept it as a Faſt upon account of the Death of her Eldeſt Son the Lord <hi>Stanhope</hi>) every Week, which was preached ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Hall, or in the Chappel at <hi>Bratby,</hi> which he accepted. She gave him great reſpect, allowed him to uſe Miniſterial freedom, which he took, being no flatterer, and ſhe bore, being a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. One inſtance may be worth noting here. A difference aroſe about precedency, the Counteſs judged her Gentlewoman ought in right to take place of a Baronets Daughters, and expected they ſhould acknowledge it, and then ſaid, <hi>She would put her Maid in her Pocket rather than ſhe ſhould give them any offence.</hi> But they not willing to yield it, the Counteſs ſent to the Earl Marſhal to decide it, who ſaid the Counteſs was in the right. Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> being to preach at <hi>Repton</hi> Exerciſe (famous not only for a Sermon, but alſo for the work of Prophecying, by one Miniſter after another opening Scripture) the Counteſs being there, he preached on that Text, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.</hi> And in an uſe of Inſtruction he commanded them that were there preſent to hear Gods words, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the good of their Souls, whilſt others were ſtriving for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency on Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This the Counteſs was ſo quick as to obſerve, and ſpeak of it to Sir <hi>Henry Leigh,</hi> who had taken no notice of it, but ſo humbled her ſelf before the word, that<note place="margin">Reader, No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. From <hi>Eggington</hi> he removed to the Town of <hi>Aſhborne.</hi> Mr. <hi>Joſeph Taylor</hi> Lecturer and School-Maſter there, falling into weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was diſabled from his Service, and being a weighty honeſt Man, much deſired to have the School and Lecturers place well ſupplyed. Purſuant to this deſign Mr. <hi>Lees</hi> of <hi>Aſhborne</hi> (every way a ſubſtantial man) took a journey to enquire after one Mr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> then, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Schoolmaſter at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> motioned to <hi>Aſhberne</hi> School. And in the <hi>Crown-Inn-gate</hi> at <hi>Derby</hi> Meeting Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Wheeldon,</hi> who had been enquiring for the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Carrier, asked them, Whether they were <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire</hi> Men? They anſwered no. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, Why he asked that queſtion? He replyed that one Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> was motioned to <hi>Aſhborne</hi> as a Sbhool-Maſter, and he knew not but that one of them might poſſibly have been the Man. Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> went on, but Mr. <hi>Wheeldon</hi> ſtepped back to him, and told him, if they wanted a School-Maſter, they could not have a fitter than his Friend there, meaning Mr. <hi>Hieron.</hi> And gave a character of him, which ſo well pleaſed Mr. <hi>Lees,</hi> that at his return home, he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mr. <hi>Pegge</hi> (an Attorney of great note and buſineſs, and inclined to good men, an Inhabitant in <hi>Aſhborne</hi>) and Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> with what he had heard, They took notice of it, and Mr. <hi>Pegge</hi> wrote to Mr. <hi>Gilbert Ward</hi> of <hi>Tickenhal</hi> (an Ingenious man, a man of Wit, Worth, and Buſineſs) who knowing Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> well, gave an account of him to ſatisfaction. Which being received, Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> wrote to Mr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> then Miniſter of <hi>Sutton,</hi> (a learned, ſober, grave, and weighty man, of whom Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>He was Logical in every thing</hi>) to deſire him to bring Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> to <hi>Aſhborne,</hi> which he did, and there they offered him the School-Maſters place at <hi>Aſhborne.</hi> He promiſed to accept it, if they could and would fairly procure it for him. Thus by a paſſage, which to us is accidental, and a meer contingency, was this worthy man brought into their thoughts at <hi>Aſhborne,</hi> but an higher Hand, and a wiſer Purpoſe directed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> (then grown unable for the School and Lecture both) ſet himſelf to work, and improved his Intereſt in the Company (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of Three Governours, and Twelve Aſſiſtants) in whom the Right of Election lay, and ingaged Ten of them for Mr. <hi>Hieron.</hi> But now it beginning to be noiſed abroad that the School would be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, one Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> put in for it, who, though he could not gain the Majority of the Governours and Aſſiſtants, yet having got ſome of them, and ſome Intereſt made by ſome great Neighbours who influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100845:7"/>
upon the Heirs of the Founders of the School (who had a kind of a Negative Voice) Three whereof were then remaining, two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were gotten for Mr. <hi>Cox,</hi> and the third for Mr. <hi>Hieron.</hi> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of them had power to ſtop the Election, and ſo it occaſioned a great conteſt. When Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſaw what oppoſition they were like to meet with, he would not have reſigned until the Coaſt were cleared, and therefore procured Mr. <hi>Whiting</hi> to teach School for him. But he perceiving there was no hope that he ſhould be the man choſen, withdrew his hand, and left Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> (by reaſon of his weakneſs) under a neceſſity of reſigning. Which he did, and two more of the Governours and Aſſiſtants being brought over, Twelve of the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen choſe Mr. <hi>Hieron.</hi> But the Heirs of the Founders not conſenting, the Election was not ratified, and ſo it fell to the Biſhop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to chooſe. Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> by the Biſhops Order was examined by Mr. <hi>Baſier</hi> the Biſhops Chaplain, who commended him much for his skill in the Tongues. The Biſhop readily gave him his Title. But then a queſtion aroſe, whether Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> being now Elect of <hi>Durham,</hi> could act as Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield:</hi> Hereupon Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications were made to Arch-Biſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> who in the vacancy of the Biſhoprick was Biſhop of it. And the Arch-Biſhop gave him his Title. But then it came to a new Diſpute, that it muſt be the Biſhop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that only could give a Title, and therefore it could not be done until the Biſhopprick were filled. By and by it was, Biſhop <hi>Wright</hi> was inſtalled, then each ſide applyed to him, and neither ſide appeared empty; for ſo was the manner then. He deferred the deciſion until he ſhould in his Viſitation come to <hi>Aſhborne;</hi> which he did, and when there moved that they ſhould wave Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> and by a great Neighbour one Mr. <hi>Mountney</hi> was propounded, and both ſides ſat down. Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> was content, he was at eaſe where he was, and having the Lecture at the truly Honourable the Counteſs of <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> for which ſhe promiſed him but Ten pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> but gave him Twelve; he judged his Salary competent, and ſo was ſatisfied. But the Lord had higher buſineſs at <hi>Aſhborne</hi> for Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> than a Free-School Tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Election of the Governours and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants was made void for want of Confirmation by the Heirs of the Founders, when Biſhop <hi>Mortons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Title was queſtioned, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops would not ſatisfie neither, Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> could have been content to have declined all further proſecution of the buſineſs. But he was deſired ſtill to ſtand for it, and his Friends promiſed that if he went without it, they would chooſe him Lecturer, and they proved as good as their words. Men wiſe and unbiaſſed pitched upon him, in whom worth was, and after the Lecturers place was void by Mr. <hi>Taylors</hi>

death, the Truſtees for the Lecture choſe Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> Lecturer. <hi>Mountney</hi> proved bad and immoral, a great diſhonour to the School, and a vexation to the Town, who ſought to the Biſhop to remove him, who alledged he could not. Then the Governours of the School ſtopped his Sallary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after articled againſt him in the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but that way giving them no Relief, they were at laſt forced to ſue him at Common Law, and it came to a Tryal before Judge <hi>Hutton</hi> (or his Collegue) and they caſt him and ejected him.</p>
               <p>But while <hi>Mountney</hi> proved ſo ill, and ſuch a vexation, Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> proved like himſelf, and an honour to his place, and ſatisfaction to the Town. He built upon Mr. <hi>Taylors</hi> foundations, and both preached and lived as that Worthy Predeceſſor did. And though Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> was dead, yet he lived, and the work was carryed on by his Succeſſor. Here Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> continued, labouring in Word and Doctrine, and procured from Biſhop <hi>Wright</hi> a Licence for a weekly Lecture to be preached at <hi>Aſhborne,</hi> which was upheld by many very able men, that ſo by the mouths of many Witneſſes what was preached on the Lords day might be confirmed, and that by mutual converſe Miniſters might be edified and comforted, as well as people advantaged.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe it was about <hi>October</hi> in the year 1635, that he married the Relict of Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> who had then, by her former Husband two Children, a Son, and a Daughter. An happy Choice he made, and very happily they lived together. She was an holy Soul, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prudent, loved her former Husbands good Acquaintance, and brought them to be Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi>'s Acquaintance. Thoſe of them that I knew honoured her indeed, and ſo did all that knew her. She was the Daughter of Parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that were conſiderable, and of very good reputation in <hi>Aſhborne.</hi> She had many Brethren and Siſters, (ſome of whom I knew) and I think I may truly ſay, that few Families produced more perſons of good brains, and excellent behaviour. I knew none of them mean in the World, and ſome of them made a conſiderable Figure in it.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> pitched, and ſtaid till the Civil Wars came on in <hi>England,</hi> and then, though a quiet Man, and fain would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at his work, yet could not, but was forced to make many withdrawments for ſecurity, which did much diſturb and tire him, and his Family were put into many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

They went back to him to acquaint him with what was done, he told them he would not go, unleſs the Order was ſealed to take with him. The Order was perfected, and the Conſtable came on the Lords day, and took him with him to <hi>Breadſall,</hi> where he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the work of the day, and returned to <hi>Derby</hi> at night. Thus he continued about ten moneths going to <hi>Breadſall</hi> on the Sabbath days, officiating there all the day, returned to his Family at <hi>Derby</hi> at night. But after that time, having ſome more probable proſpect of Safety at <hi>Bradſall,</hi> he removed his Family thither, <hi>November</hi> 1. 1644.

Here may you ſee how Gods Providence finds work for them that have a mind to work, willing minds do not ordinarily want opportunities long, but God opens a door for them.

He was a good Man, as it's ſaid of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> he was a Learned Man, he had much of <hi>Egypts</hi> Gold and Treaſure, and brought it all to Gods Tabernacle. He was well read in Books and good Authors, a very ſtudious man: He was well ſeen in Hiſtory, and very frequently in converſe made an excellent uſe thereof. He had a ſharp judgment, he was a great Maſter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, had digeſted his Tutors Method of preaching thoroughly: He had a very ſtrong memory, which continued to the laſt; ſo that if there were any doubt about the quantity of any Syllable, he had a Verſe ready to ſhew what it was. He had ſearched into Chronology of Scripture, knew much about it, and was ready in it. But he was almoſt a Non-ſuch in his Bible; you could not name a difficulty, but he was ready to give the unfolding of it, or what was ſaid to it. He was moſt ready in the references of one Scripture to another, and could readily turn to them. He had an excellent faculty in expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture, in opening a Chapter, he opened his Text with great clearneſs. He had a gravity in Countenance and Carriage, and in his Delivery. He was a Mall of unſound Opinions, though he did not delight in preaching Controverſies, yet when it fell in his way, his matter naturally leading to it, he would ſo diſtinctly ſtate Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted points, and leave them ſo clear, that there would ſcarce ſeem to be any thing of controverſie in them. He was a cloſe and wiſe reprover. He was a powerful preſſer to duty; he was excellent in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100845:9"/>
Inſtruction, skilful to direct to means, very compaſſionate in dealing with tender, troubled Souls, able to give ſtrong Cordials, and very diſcerning to know to whom to give them. In a word, he was a Scribe inſtructed to the Kingdom of God, had Treaſures, and could bring forth things new and old. He was a good and faithful Steward of the Myſteries of God; he was able and apt to teach, furniſhed both with an Heart well headed, and an Head well hearted; he was skilful, and faithful, a ſound Believer of what he preached, zealous for God, no body that heard him could ſuſpect him of being in jeſt, all muſt conclude he was in earneſt, and that his words were in his heart, and that they came out thence. His breath was warm, which teſtified Life within, and heartineſs for God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. As to the diſcharge of his Miniſtry I muſt be a little more particular. He did ſhew his qualifications, his ſincere ends in entring into the Miniſtry by his conſcionable fulfilling his Miniſtry received of the Lord, doing the work of a Miniſter, making full proof of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was a Workman, and a working man, a dextrous labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in Gods Vineyard, a painful and skilful Husbandman whom God had inſtructed to diſcretion, and had taught him. He diſpenſed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Myſteries, the Word and Sacrament as a Miniſter of Chriſt; and a faithful Steward of the Myſteries of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He was well ſatisfied about the Doctrine of the Lords day, as a Chriſtian Sabbath; and accordingly he did earneſtly contend with the Profaners of the Lords day, zealouſly preſt its ſanctification, and in his own practice was a practical Sabbatarian. This would appear both from what he did at <hi>Aſhborne,</hi> and alſo after at <hi>Breadſall.</hi> But take for proof what follows. Some time after his ſetling at <hi>Aſhborne,</hi> the Book for Sports on the Lords day came forth; and preſently was the fear of Gods Commandment caſt off (the applications of the Sabbath to the ends of it's inſtitution being one of thoſe bands and cords, that corrupt nature would fain break, and is glad of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to caſt away) Unbridled youth preſently took the liberty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and Tidings being brought to Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> he got to Mr. <hi>Pegge,</hi> a Man of Authority in <hi>Aſhborne</hi> to accompany him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and coming to them, they found Boys and Youths ſhooting at the Butts, and only one man with them; and being demanded why they did ſo? The man anſwered that the Biſhop gave them leave. How doth that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſaid Mr. <hi>Hieron?</hi> The man anſwered; on ſuch a Sabbath day I came through <hi>Eccleſhall</hi> (where then the Biſhops ſeat was) and ſaw there a Bear baiting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> rejoyns, that's no proof, for the Caſtle is at ſome diſtance from the Town, and the Biſhop might be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100845:9"/>
ſaid, If it offended them he would forbear, and ſo the Company parted.</p>
               <p>But a while after he went to another Company, got together on the like occaſion, where he met with a man who argued the King allowed it, and thoſe would not part.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his Life having preached about the Obſervation of the Lords-day, and therein reproved that bad Cuſtom which the Butchers of that Town uſed of ſelling Meat on the Lords-days in the Morning. When Biſhop <hi>Wright</hi> afterwards came to viſit there, ſome, who were loath to for go that bad Cuſtom, dealt with him in private about it, and ſo far gained on him, that in his Charge or Speech he mentioned it, and uſed this inſtance, <hi>Suppoſe a Labouring Man receives his Wages ſo late on the Saturday night, that before he can get home, the Shops are ſhut up, and no Meat then to be bought, ſhall not the poor Man therefore have a chop of Meat to his Dinner the next day</hi> (with great noiſe the Biſhop added) God forbid. Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> well underſtood this reflection, and others took ſo much notice of it, as to take en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from it. Yet notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> preaching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Commandments, when he came in courſe to the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, returned upon the reproof of this ſin; and raiſing an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, but ſome may ſay my Lord Biſhop gives us leave. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Suppoſe that were ſo, Whether is it reaſnable to regard what one Biſhop might ſay in a private place, more than what that Biſhop, and all the Biſhops in</hi> England <hi>had ſaid in Parliament</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Statute of 3. <hi>Caroli</hi> with him in the Pulpit, he read it to them, and told them, there were but ſo many years paſſed, ſince this was enacted by Kings, Lords, and Commons; and that this Biſhop on whoſe Authority they ſo much relied, was one of the Number, being then Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> This put them a little to a ſtand, yet one of them ſaid, he would notwithſtanding hear what ſuch a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, not far diſtant, would ſay to it. Whether they reformed or not, I cannot well ſay, but Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> did his duty with Zeal and Courage Theſe inſtances may ſuffice to illuſtrate and prove this head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was a Man that filled the Sabbath with its proper Exerciſes. It was a painful day to him, yet not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grievous, becauſe the day was his delight, and holy employment was his refreſhment. He prayed, he read the Scripture, and expounded it; he ſung Pſalms, he cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed and expounded the Catechiſm, he preached twice a day, and this he did with that holy zeal and earneſtneſs, that ſometimes (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the ſpring of the year) he hath been ſo ſore upon the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, that he could not endure to ſit; but was forced to walk about
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100845:10"/>
in his Room, whilſt he was able, and then to try if he could find out any other poſtures which might be more eaſie to him than ſitting was. He ſtuck cloſe to his people, gave them their full proviſion, and when the neceſſitics of ſome Neighboring places called for a ſupply, he hath ſometimes preached thrice a day rather than his own people ſhould be ſhortned. He very rarely exchanged with any body on the Sabbath, kept his own Vineyard, and kept to it. <hi>Breadſall</hi> wanted preaching when they ſought for him, but never wanted after they found him. He adminiſtred both the Sacraments in their Seaſons, and for the inſtructing and admoniſhing part of diſcipline he was abundant in it. He taught publickly, and from houſe to houſe, warning every one, and teaching every one. The younger he catechiſed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, the elder at home went to their Houſes, called them to his. The Sermons preached at Church were repeated in his houſe, all his willing Neighbours were welcome, and for ſome time conſiderable numbers did frequent thoſe repetitions. And for their encouragement ſo to do, he would ſometimes in the week-day invite to Supper ſuch as came to Repetition and Prayer on the Lords-day, and after Supper let them play and uſe ſome fit Recreations, and be innocently as merry as they would, being no enemy to harmleſs mirth in its own proper ſeaſon. He took all occaſions to do them good. I have caſt ſome ſorrowful looks at that place ſince he was thruſt out of it, as fearing that Vineyard was like to become as the Sluggards field, having loft his cultivation of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He confined not his labours within his own charge and precincts, but was ready and frequent in week-day work abroad. His Fountain was diſperſed abroad, and Rivers of Waters in the Country Villages. He aſſiſted in upholding moſt Lectures, and then there were many, by putting his hand to them. He ſet up a Monthly Lecture at <hi>Dale-Abby,</hi> which for ſome time he only preached at himſelf, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Congregation being there gathered by him, other Miniſters came in to his aſſiſtance, and made that ſingle Lecture a double one. This Exerciſe was kindly embraced by the people at <hi>Dale,</hi> and was well frequented, till the anti-religious Spirit aroſe in 1662. and then the Miniſters who were to preach hearing of an armed Rabble coming from <hi>Derby</hi> to break them up; after they had adviſed with the people, reſolved to deſiſt and deſperſe themſelves, and ſo gave way to thoſe furious Bigots. <hi>Let a Bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a Fool in his folly, Prov.</hi> 17. 12. This glorious Victory they obtained, to ſcatter a Meeting whoſe only crime was ſerving God, and to put an end to a Meeting there, where Viſion was very rare, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much needed. So ended this, and moſt of the Meetings in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100845:10"/>
Countrey. This was about <hi>July,</hi> I think, and in <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, the Miniſters now diſturbed were ſilenced, not by a rude ſelf-calling, and ſelf-raiſing Rabble, but by a formality of Law, which in Gods time I hope will appear to be according to that phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 2. a weighing of the violence of Mens hands in the earth, an holding balances in hands, the emblem of Juſtice, as if they would propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion puniſhments to faults, but tilled and turned the Scale by revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful malice, and to curry favour with the Enemies of all Righteouſneſs, ſentenced an Innocent, uſeful Seed of Men, whom God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver caſt off, though they caſt them out. And I am not without hopes that ſome of them may live to have a <hi>Paphnutius</hi>'s kiſs from a <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s mouth, <hi>Amen,</hi> if God ſee that good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where ever he preached at home, or abroad, he preached the Word, he was a Scriptural Preacher, not Chaff, but Wheat was ſown by him; not Niceties and Subtilties, but ſound Doctrine, well digeſted truth in ſignificant words was delivered by him. Gingling, tickling the Ear, patching and painting the Face of Truth, daubing with intempered Morter, were things he practiſed not, yea, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred them. His Sermons were no flattering glaſſes, but true clear Mirrours to ſhew Men the true Complexion of their Souls.</p>
               <p>He had Art enough, but he concealed it, he had much Learning, but it all ſerved Divinity; he had Logick and Philoſophy enough, but he planted no <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Grove by the ſide of Gods Altar. He had method enough to divide a Text, but he never crumbled a Text; he divided the Word into fit Portions, he never ſtrained a Text, but would be ſure to give you the proper fruit from ſuch a branch of Scripture. I never knew him impertinent. Indeed if ever Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed according to the proportion of Faith, if ever Man compared Spiritual things with ſpiritual, if ever man ſpake as the Lords Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, in the Lords Meſſage, as is ſaid of the Prophet <hi>Haggaii; Hag.</hi> 13. if ever man filled his Veſſel at the Holy Fountains, if ever man took his Words from one Shepherd, if ever man brought light to Scripture from Scripture, and made it to interpret it ſelf, he did. Bleſſed be God there are many ſuch, and he muſt be ranked amongſt ſuch men. His Sermons on heads of Divinity, his Diſcourſe of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual joy, prove what I ſay.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He managed the Holy Sacraments with a great deal of care, fear, pains, and circumſpection, according to the weight and worth of thoſe high and Holy Miſteries.</p>
               <p>As for Baptiſme he very rarely adminiſtred it in private, and never but where neceſſity and charity required it. His conſtant way was this, The ſecond Lords day after the birth, he appointed the Children
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100845:11"/>
to be brought to the Church, and there after Evening Sermon made all the Congregation Witneſſes; and if any had offered to go out, he would call to them, and tell them there was great need they ſhould all underſtand the Baptiſmal Covenant. He never opened the Service-Book after the Ordinance of Parliament required to ſhut it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Directory to take place; yet I doubt not, but he gave as clear inſtructions, as powerful exhortations and charges, and put up as pertinent Prayers, as that Book or any other Form for that Office, doth or can afford.</p>
               <p>As for the Supper of the Lord he adminiſtred it quarterly; had alwayes a preparation Sermon, and many times two, when he could procure help; he took great pains in taking an account of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing his Communicants: If any had miſcarried, he failed not to admoniſh them: He made great Obſervations how he found them: He had his ſearching Queſtions about Converſion, about Title to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, about Repentance, <q>Do not all acknowledge it neceſſary? Have you repented? If not, why not now? Are we not frail? Time ſhort and uncertain.</q> He had his excitations to the cure of Souls, and indeed he was no way wanting to help his People to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God in their near approach to him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He was very exact in performing his duty to his People, but very moderate in requiring his legal dues from his People: He took little of the Poor, and gave them much: And for others in leſſer things he took what they brought, and made no ſtrict inquiry: He forbore ſome ſmaller things till ſome took occaſion to deny them to be due, and then being obliged to maintain the Rights of the place, he ordered his Clark to demand them: He was forbearing; After his ejection he found many had not reckoned with him of ſeveral years, he ſued only one, (not of his Pariſh that denyed any Tithe to be due to him, and led away as much at one time as was of a conſiderable value. This he might not bear, ſo applyed to the Juſtices, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearing adjudged him his own with the penalty upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt with-holder, but he only took his own and what he had ſpent, and a Shilling to his Servant, and returned the reſt. If it might not have been a detriment to the place for the future, I am apt to think he would have ſitten down with loſs, for his deſign was the Peoples benefit; he ſought not theirs but them, and that he might gain upon them, he ws content to be a Looſer. He was a good Townſ-man as well as a good Miniſter. There are two clear Inſtances.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) He procured a Relaxation and Mitigation of their Aſſeſsments by clearing it to them then in power, that there was reaſon for it, and improving his intereſt in them, procured eaſe.</item>

                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100845:11"/>(2.) There was a Town-Stock in <hi>Breadſall,</hi> which being ſent out among them in ſmall ſummes, was frequently endangered to come lame home: Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> oft adviſed, it might be laid out in Land, which they never would yield to, but when there was a proſpect of his going out (he having promiſed them Ten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ounds if they would buy Land) they accepted, and he as good as his word gave them his Ten Pounds, and ſo there is Land that yields Three Pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> ſetled on Truſtees for the uſe of the poor of <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </list>
               <p n="7">7. His Heart was much ſet upon Succeſs and Fruit among his own People, that in that place he might be able to ſay that there was Fruits, yea, all manner of pleaſant Fruits, new and old, <hi>laid up for thee, O beloved. Cant.</hi> 7. laſt. This appeared ſundry ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) He was pleaſed that God had given him a People that were frameable to an outward conformity; but Oh! where is the <hi>Jew</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly? The power of Godlineſs? He was no Formaliſt himſelf, and he could not take up with ſhapes of Chriſtians; but longed to ſee real Heart-Chriſtians.</item>
                  <item>(2.) He was full of thoughts of heart when he found not his deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſucceſs attend his work, and would break out thus; How ſhall I do more? How ſhall I do better? How ſhall I pray more? How ſhall I preach better?</item>
                  <item>(3.) The Fruit he had in <hi>Breadſall,</hi> (as bleſſed be God he had ſome.) Oh! it was as the firſt ripe Fruits: Oh! a <hi>Breadſall</hi>-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian was as a <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as a <hi>Benjamin</hi> to Old <hi>Jacob:</hi> They were in his Bowels; his Soul cleaved to them; they were his Joy and Crown.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="8">8. He was a man of Hoſpitality and Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Strangers and Friends found him ſo in courteous entertainments: No good man needed to ſeek a publick Houſe in <hi>Breadſall</hi> to lodge in, nor ſtrain to reach <hi>Derby.</hi> The Church had a <hi>Gains</hi> at <hi>Breadſall.</hi> And for his Charity; his lending and his giving was conſiderable: It extended it ſelf to all the Poor in <hi>Breadſall,</hi> in Bread, in Coats, in Corn, in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; yea it extended to poor Chriſtians diſtant from him. After he had left <hi>Breadſall</hi>-Living he ſent Money thither to be diſpoſed as he directed: He deviſed liberal things, forecaſted in hard years to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Corn for the poor; though it ſometimes proved to his outward loſs. Thus was he full of the good Word of God, and of good Works. His Acquaintances, Neighbours, Kindred, will teſtifie theſe things. I could on this head be more large and particular, but this taſte may ſuffice; they that knew him can inlarge upon theſe hints; they that knew him not may take their meaſures from theſe ſhort touches. To conclude, he was a good man, and that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100845:12"/>
was not barren, but had the moſt undeniable Evidences, even thoſe that Jeſus Chriſt will go upon in the day of Judgment.</p>
               <p n="9">9. He was a bold, ſharp, cloſe reprover of ſin, and yet very tender and compaſſionate in dealing with tender Conſciences, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wounded Spirits. Some of his great Neighbours while at <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> did profane the Sabbath, and openly drunk healths in the Market place; he as boldly reproved it, as they did impudently commit it; and this when the War came on, made him to be repreſented as a <hi>Round-head,</hi> and by the inſtigation of thoſe Neighbours, he was one of the firſt in <hi>Aſhborn</hi> that had his Houſe broken in upon by Sir <hi>Francis Wortleys</hi> Party, he taken, and impriſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed by them; and as by the words they let fall, he underſtood, it was in revenge of his Reproofs. He was an hearty enemy to ſin, ſtruck at it with his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual weapons with all the ſtrength of his arm: He launced feſtered ſores: He attacked ſturdy reſolved ſinners with reſolute charges: He beat down ſin ſo, that ſome touched with <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> thought him too legal, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ked him, <hi>by what warrant Miniſters under the Goſpel preached the Law ſo much;</hi> he readily anſwered; <hi>The words of their Commiſſion were a ſufficient warrant,</hi> citing that Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. and added, <hi>Is not that as terrible a preaching of the Law as any Miniſter now doth, or can practiſe.</hi> To which the Objecter made no reply. But on the other hand, though he lifted up his voice againſt ſin, like a trumpet, yet he neither cryed nor lift up his voice, when he had to deal with bruiſed reeds, then he bound up their Wounds charily, and had the Oyl of Joy for them that were in the Spirit of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Many diſquieted hearts would make to him, and he would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="10">10. He backed his Doctrine with a good Life: He was the ſame man out of the Pulpit, that he was in it: He was a Preacher, and a Pattern; what People heard from him, they ſaw in him: He was all Voice, Mouth, and Life, his Converſation was a viſible Sermon: He was a follower of Chriſt, mighty in word and deed. He mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted a ſpirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord. We may ſay of him, as the Woman of her dead Husband, <hi>Thou knoweſt that thy Servant did fear the Lord.</hi> No profaneneſs went from him into any place where he taught: His Doctrine was a pure lip, and his Life exemplary; his Doctrine was pure and ſavoury, his Breath ſweet, and his Life tinctured with holineſs in every turn of it. He
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100845:12"/>
came, as <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> in the way of Righteouſneſs; he lived in all good Conſcience; his walking was in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not in fleſhly wiſdom. He condemned not, confuted not, his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by contrary practice; but he confirmed it, eſtabliſhed it, and juſtified the Wiſdom he taught. He wrought with both hands ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, as ſome are ſaid to ſin. He pulled not down with one hand, what he built up with the other; he ſpoke with his feet, and taught with his fingers. He ſpake convincingly ſound Doctrine, ſtopping Gainſayers mouths, and he lived convincingly: They could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, nor reflect, nor ſay, <hi>Phyſician, heal thy ſelf.</hi> His blameleſs Life ſtopped the mouth of iniquity.</p>
               <p n="11">11. He was a man of much Prayer, and ſo a man of much Grace. He preſſed Prayer much, he practiſed it more. He gave himſelf to Prayer. His Grace exceeded his gift, though in the gift of Prayer he was very great. He prayed with all Prayer, Publick, Family, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Prayer. He went through the parts of Prayer, was large in Confeſſion of Sin, was very particular in thankful acknowledgment of Mercies, and an earneſt Petitioner for Grace and Mercy, for all Spiritual Bleſſings; a pleading Interceſſour for all that he was bound to pray for. He not only prayed, but made a <hi>Collection of Prayers,</hi> called ſober People together, and went to them where Prayer was made. He called People frequently to days of Prayer. He carried the Churches abroad, and our Kingdoms and Churches upon his heart, and ſpread their caſe before the Lord. He was an hearty Proteſtant, and a true enemy to Antichriſtianiſm. He was a Prophet in Sack-cloth; becauſe of the great Apoſtaſie. He was very ſenſible of Romiſh Idolatry. Oh! how much of his heart might one feel, when he prayed, <hi>Down with Babylon.</hi> Oh, how have I heard him lay his praying hand upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> and cry, as if he would not take off his hand, till he had pulled it down, pleading from their Hereſie, Tyranny and Idolatry, as if he would have no denial. He was very ſerious in Prayer, and a great admirer and acknowledger of Grace, when he mentioned any good in himſelf, or them that joyned with him, it was with much humility, and alwayes ſpake thus, or to this purpoſe: <hi>And if there be any good in us, not unto us, not unto us, but to thy Grace be the Glory.</hi> From a thread to a ſhooe-latchet he would not take from Grace.</p>
               <p n="12">12. He magnified and dignified his Office by humility, by great moderation in things that are Problems amongſt good men, by a great ſteadineſs. When any body mentioned any good done by him, he would ſay, <hi>Give Glory to God, this man is a ſinner.</hi> I never knew that he eſtranged himſelf from his Conforming Brethren, that were

before his Intimates; but he kept up his honour of them, and love to them. He kept his poſt, was no bending Oſier; he deliberated m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He had been conformable; but I believe, not with any great liking, and was not willing to chooſe that way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and condemn his laying it aſide, and therefore would do neither leſs nor more, but put himſelf into Gods hands; and choſe to keep his peace, though he loſt his place; and for any thing that ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, never repented; nay, he had great ſatisfaction. One once asked him, <hi>Do you not repent? What do you mean,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my place? No; I am far from that, for I have done nothing therein, but what I have taught you to be your Duty. Rather loſe all, than ſin againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="13">13. In the works of his Miniſtry, which are not to me ſo clearly Miniſterial works, he went further than moſt other Miniſters.—I ſhall inſtance in Marrying people; he ſtood upon it in very great ſtrictneſs to have a full aſſurance of Parents conſent, and a due pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Marriage intended. And in Burials his way was, if he preached a Funeral Sermon, for which he had Money, he would (ſometimes at the leaſt) give it to the Poor. If no Sermon were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken, he would take the People into the Church, and give them an Exhortation of the length of ſome ordinary Sermons; and this he did, becauſe People at ſuch times are more ſerious and impreſſible, and he was for catching hold of all opportunities, as impotent People were at the troubling of <hi>Betheſda's</hi> waters.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In the places of his Miniſtry he had great reſpect, and ever bore great affection to thoſe places; the care of them lay upon him. He had a great regard to <hi>Aſhborn</hi> all his time, and a mighty concern for <hi>Breadſall.</hi> The Cures paſſed into other hands, but the Care was upon him. He would go to <hi>Breadſall,</hi> while he was near it, though called a Wolf for his pains by his ſucceſſor. He put himſelf to many inconveniences by his firſt remove, that he might be near them; he took up with a ſtrait houſe, that he might be at hand for his Peoples ſervice, and that he might live among a People that were his Hearers, though not his Pariſhioners, namely at <hi>Little-Eaton.</hi>

About <hi>December</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1637. Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Lees</hi> of <hi>Aſhborn</hi> above-mentioned, were ſummoned to appear at the Mannor of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> on the firſt of <hi>February,</hi> between the Hours of One and Three in the Afternoon, to anſwer to ſuch Articles as were or ſhould be exhibited againſt them. A Purſivant was ſent, who had his Fees: Mr. <hi>Hierons</hi> part, as my Author remembers, was Four Pounds paid down; Mr. <hi>Lees</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home, ſome other paid his part, and got a Noble abated.—To <hi>London</hi> they went at an ill time of year, made more dangerous by reaſon of Floods, they made ſome way to <hi>Holt,</hi> who was <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritor Apparitorum.</hi> He treated with Sack, and feed with Gold, ſhewed them the Articles, which contained no Capital Crimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a Purſivant, but trivial things and uncapable of proof; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Lees</hi> was objected, that when he was Churchwarden, he had brewed Ale in the Church, which had no other colour then, that the Workman that pointed the Steeple, adviſed the Mortar ſhould be tempered with Liquor made of Malt.—Againſt Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> that preaching on that Text, [<hi>Fear God, Honour the King,</hi>] he had ſaid, there were ſome that neither feared God, nor honoured the King; but walked the ſtreets with impudent faces, whereby he meant, (as they ſuggeſted) my Lord Biſhop and <hi>Andrew Kniveton.</hi> And that he had uſed the expreſſion of removing Mountains; whereby he reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Mr. <hi>Mountney</hi> and reflected on him, the Governours of the School having removed him, as is aboveſaid.—This they looked on as Mercy, that having ſeen the Articles of their charge, they might ſafely take the Oath <hi>ex Officio,</hi> the refuſal whereof would have ſent them to Priſon.—. No Proſecutor appeared, they feed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to make a motion, that ſince no Proſecutor appeared, the Court would pleaſe to diſmiſs them; he like a Proctor of ſuch a Court, moved that the Court would appoint a Proſecutor; ſo they were not diſmiſſed.—They therefore applyed themſelves to Dr. <hi>Bak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh how good was God, when he took away the High Commiſſion!

Sir <hi>Francis Wortleys</hi> party coming to <hi>Aſhborn,</hi> one Captain <hi>Bard</hi> and <hi>Dennis</hi> in the dead time of the night, broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Houſe, took him out of his Bed; Captain <hi>Dennis</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen cannot drink the Kings health, but you muſt reprove them for it: Oh,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Hieron, Sir</hi> John Fitz-Herberts <hi>hand is in this.</hi> They carried him to their Court of Guard, and kept him there till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where urging him to ſpeak of many things, lay at catch for matter to accuſe him: Sir <hi>Francis Wortley</hi> charged him for preaching againſt Epiſcopacy; he anſwered, never; but againſt the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of it.—His Wives Father paſſed his word for him, which was at preſent ſatisfying; the next day he appeared, Sir <hi>Francis</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to releaſe him; but would have him call the Parliament a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of diſſemblers, but he would not. In the upſhot they diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; he deſired his Horſe and Saddle to be reſtored: <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaith Sir <hi>Francis, you may be glad you are at liberty your ſelf.</hi>—During this Impriſonment, one of the Captains, (<hi>viz</hi>) Captain <hi>Bard</hi> had been with an Honourable Perſon, then living in <hi>Aſhborn,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Captain <hi>Bard</hi> was ſo ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that after his marching thence, wrote to Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> begging pardon of him and of his Wife. Thus God brought forth this good Mans Righteouſneſs, to the ſhame of all his falſe Accuſers.</p>

Whether ſome ill Neighbours going to create him trouble, miſtook the Party, and told the errand to a very Friend of Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi>'s, who ſent him Priſoner to <hi>Derby,</hi> but the ill ſucceſs of this firſt attempt did not deterr others: But ſtill others aroſe, and a Party beſet the Houſe, entred and ſearched, but by Gods good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he was not at home, and ſo they returned without him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting his dear Wife, and pilfering ſome few things. This bred great uneaſineſs in Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> and at length forced him to <hi>Derby,</hi> which at preſent was a place of Retreat, a <hi>Zoar</hi> to him, ſecured him and his from fears in the Night, and in a very little time after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, God provided a Laboratory, a Work-houſe for him.</p>

Peaceable Sabbaths, here he met with no War, but did himſelf war againſt the Devils Kingdom. Luſts of Men, and Wickedneſs of Times, contentfully ſeated and ſetled working hard, had great meaſures of health, though mixt with ſome Feavors, which were moſtly the effects of his extraordinary pains, and went off without any very long deteinures from his Work. Here he enjoyed a good Living, converſed with a very precious Wife, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among his Children. Here he and ſhe ſhewed themſelves Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Hoſpitality, Lovers of good Men, Sober, Juſt, Holy, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, wone much upon ſome that had prejudice againſt him; Thus the Lords Candle ſhone upon his Head for many years—But in the year 1657, his ſprightly, his lively Wife fell ill of an Ague, and a perverſe one, which being a double Tertian, and mixt with an high degree of the Scurvy. No Phyſical Applications, no Change of Air would prevail for (whither ſhe went for Air, <hi>viz.</hi> to Sir <hi>John Gells</hi> of <hi>Hopton,</hi> then <hi>John Gell,</hi> Eſq;) who with his Wife loved and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all good people, and had a ſpecial Reſpect to this Matron and to her Husband, there ſhe expired, and by her deſire, or her Friends, was interred at <hi>Aſhburne</hi> with a due Solemnity, chargeable to her Husband, but not begrudged, for great was his Love to her, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of her, which appears by his own record of her death, <hi>July 10th 1657.

And it was very deeply reſented by her Husband. She brought him Two Children, <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Anne Taylor, Samuel</hi> dyed young, but <hi>Anne</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived

She bore him Two Children, <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who is alive, the genuine Son of a Worthy Father, He was alive when this was written: is now tranſlated to a better Life before this comes to be publiſhed: And <hi>Rachell</hi> who dyed before her Father, one that was glorious within, of excellent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Wit, and Memory, a Lover of every thing that was good. Now though this affliction was very grievous, yet was it to my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation wonderfully ſanctified, greatly ſweetned and alienated. In my thoughts that Rod bloſſomed, it was a growing time with him in Grace from that time, he was alwayes above his Fellows, but then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove himſelf, made ſenſibly a partaker of Gods Holineſs, and received the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs by that his Exerciſe—And it was greatly ſweetned and alienated by his Daughter in Law, Mrs. <hi>Anne Taylor,</hi> the true Daughter of her Mother, who was a <hi>Mary</hi> in her choice of the better part, and bore that Affection to her Father in Law, which few Natural Children equal, and ſcarce any exceed; ſhe was as a Wife to him, as a Mother to his Children, a Governeſs to his Houſe. She took all the Family Burdens on her ſelf; that he might be void of care, and ſerve God in his own buſineſs without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction. She lived ſingle, ſhe cumbred herſelf, would put her hand to every thing, ſhe was frugal, but not ſordid; ſhe was a Reſtorer of his Life, and nouriſher of his Age: So that two great and Singular things may be ſaid of her, that never Man had ſo great a loſs in a Wife made up in a tender, prudeut, provident Daughter in Law; ſhe did the Duties of a Wife, a Mother, and yet lived and dyed a Virgin: Oh this many a time warmed this good Mans heart, and he would men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a great and good Act of Providence—Again all this ſhe did for his Works ſake, for Gods ſake, for the Goſpels ſake, in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion what ſhe did is a good gloſs upon that Text, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 3. Where Paul mentions Women, that laboured with him in the Goſpel, not in preaching, which is forbidden: but in good Offices in miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſervices proper for that Sex. Such an one was Mrs. <hi>Anne Taylor, a Phebe,</hi> a <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> a <hi>Mary.</hi> She out-lived her Father; but I am apt to think a great part of her Life dyed with him; becauſe it was ſo much bound up in his.</p>

               <p n="4">4. When that Declaration was recall'd, he held on doing; but with the Caution which the Times forced him to, and his Prudence directed in apparent danger; forbearing, but yet never deſiſting, nor giving out; and by this means he kept work on wheels, and expoſed not his Hearers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. About thoſe times he Printed his firſt Book, or Sermons, being urged to Print ſomething—And his latter Book he Printed, becauſe many Chriſtians acquainted him with their troubles, whom he always comforted, and wrote that Book to chear the Hearts, and lighten the Countenances of them that walked droopingly—He himſelf would be chearful in Company, to wipe off the ſlander caſt upon Religion, that it makes men ſour, moroſe, and ſpoils good Company.</p>

He would tell his very friends, that never any could take any thing ill from him, where they miſſed it in any paſſages in a Sermon; and ſome that now live, acknowledge themſelves much beholden to him; for they knew he was accurate, though not nice; truly critical, tho' not cenſorious; exactly methodical, though not limiting others; but left them to their own method and way.

               <p n="10">10. He was zealous for God, and his motion like natural motion, was quickeſt in its end. In many of his Books where he writ his Name, he adds to it, <gap reason="foreign">

they were in each other—God hath made her fruitful. Her Father in Law had great content in her, and was very ſenſible of this good Providence - He ſaw a Child Born, that bears his Name.</p>
               <p n="12">12. This <hi>Loſco</hi> remove was a very happy one to Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> and was a matter of Song to him in the houſe of his Pilgrimage—Here was a great gathering to him from many quarters. To the Carkaſs the Eagles gathered. He was next to a publick place here, had great numbers, and preached as in his former dayes. Here in a little time he had a choice Society of ſerious Souls; amongſt whom he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the Sacrament in its ſtated times, with its wonted preparations; amongſt theſe he had conſtant dayes of Prayer, which upon emergent occaſions were multiplyed, and very frequent—Here God gave him much ſucceſs, the Goſpel got much ground; ſome brought in, and others brought on; many that were bad made good, and the good much better; ſome were planted, and others watered; ſome got root, and others better rooted. He was as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> fruitful in a ſtrange Land; and becauſe of this forgot his ſorrow; he ſaw God had directed his removes for the furtherance of the Goſpel; led him not amongſt heaps of ſtones, as it's ſaid, <hi>Beda's</hi> Lad led him, but was ſent into ſeveral places to help them. God led him into places, where were well affected people, willing to hear, and were glad at heart of him—They flocked in as Doves to the windows, and many were the Children of this deſolate Man, he laboured not in vain, he ſacrilegiouſly deſerted not his Miniſtry, and the Lord forſook not him. It may be ſaid of him in a proportion, as was Prophetically ſaid of <hi>John Baptiſt, Luk.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17. and actually of <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 11. 24. he turned many to the Lord, <hi>much people was added to the Lord by him.</hi> Acts 11. 21. <hi>The hand of the Lord was with this ſcattered Servant of God, and ſome numbers believed, and turned to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. From hence he wrote many Letters, upon divers occaſions, to ſeveral perſons to very good purpoſe; they are of the ſame make with his Sermons as he Printed; ſo his conſtant Preaching was; he went abroad in the ſame Cloaths he wore at home. As he Preached, ſo he Wrote; ſuch as his Sermons, ſuch his Letters; proving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as was ſaid of <hi>Ezra, a ready ſcribe</hi> Ezra 7. 6. <hi>in the word which the Lord had given.</hi> A great wiſdom he had in bringing down gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules to particular Caſes; he manifeſted in them great concern for Souls, and faithfulneſs to them. Some of thoſe ſhall be inſerted in the laſt Chapter of this Treatiſe</p>

outward Indications of them; but there are ſome ſhort hints of Gods dealings with him, left under his own hand, which ſpake him to be a Man of Communion with God, that there were exchanges of Love betwixt God and him. Some of them were before his coming hither; but moſt of them at <hi>Loſco</hi>—Some of them the actings of Grace in his own Heart, and ſome of them Gods gracious dealings with him in wayes of quickenings and comforts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Octob.</hi> 27. 1658. I was not well, had a pain in my Belly from ſide to ſide in the beginning of the Night, I feared falling into Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—Communed with my heart upon my Bed, had thoughts of Death, my Conſcience ſpake peace to me, the light of Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhone into me, I was fully aſſured of Gods Mercy to me, if I had dyed at that time. I had no doubt of my eternal happineſs for which Mercy I give God praiſe, and deſire to record it, with much thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>But I ſlept well that night, was well next day, continued well, for which Mercy, double Mercy, the Lord be magnified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January,</hi> 1650. By night on my Bed I awaked, had ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the King led me into the Wine-cellar. Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul. <hi>April</hi> 10. A Communion <hi>in noſtro Thalamo; i. e.</hi> in our Bed-Chamber. <hi>April</hi> 8. We faſted, I was in a reaſonable good frame; but had ſome diſturbance: <hi>April</hi> 9. I was very dull, no quickening, no comfort; I read, I reviewed the Catalogue of my Sins, but was ſtill dull. After five a Clock I went to ſecret Prayer for leſs than half an hour; after which I was chearful, full of comfort, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued that night and next day, much enlarged in comfort, God ſpake peace to my heart. I was lively in Prayer, in Adminiſtration, in the whole Service. <hi>Bleſs the Lord O my Soul! Auguſt</hi> 2. 1664. I went to Bed with ſome pain, ſlept not, had no eaſe, walked in the Houſe all night, dull at firſt, but after chearful, had ſome good thoughts, the light of Gods Countenance ſhone on my Soul all night, I was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100845:18"/>
willing to dye, not queſtioning my eſtate; but if I dyed I ſhould be happy. About four a Clock in the Morning I had eaſe, was well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, fell to work all day, at Night voided a Stone, ſlept all Night very well, ſo continue to this day, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 10. Immortal Praiſe be to God that healeth me; but I render not to God according to his benefits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decemb.</hi> 2. 4. 8. 1664. We ſought God, received Sacrament, returned Praiſe, I was dull before; was graciouſly enlarged in Prayer, in Adminiſtration, had Comfort in Receiving, I was dull again before Thankſgiving, Read a while in <hi>Baxter</hi> and <hi>Harris,</hi> and much enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Duty, had ſweet Peace at Sacrament, and after Praiſe, the Lord ſealed to me Jeſus Chriſt, Covenant of Grace, and Pardon of Sin. <hi>O bleſs the Lord, O my Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 1. 1664. We ſpent ſome time in Humiliation at our Houſe by Night, was in ſome good meaſure enabled; in the Morning in a good frame, poured out my Heart in ſecret, had much Comfort and Peace, <hi>bleſs the Lord, O my Soul,</hi> and ſo have had ever ſince.: Alſo at Sacrament, <hi>April 2. 1665.

               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 6. 1666. Early at five I awaked, had ſweet Meditations of Gods Love and great Comfort, after ſome clouds and ſcruples, God enlarged my Heart, and put gladneſs, <hi>more then when Corn and Wine encreaſed. Lord grant I may abide in his Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> 2. 1667. An Ague ſiezed me after four fits, ſent for Mr. <hi>Cranwell,</hi> he gave me a bitter Draught, which ſweat me an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fit: I had no more Fits, nor Relapſe, <hi>I bleſs God.</hi> In the beginning dull and dark, but after a Night or two ſweet Comfort, and ſo continueth to this day, <hi>bleſſed be God;—May</hi> 2. 1667. I returned thanks among Chriſtians on this Text, <hi>Pſal. 103. 3. Who healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 3. 1668. I awoke at four in the Morning, had ſweet Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Communion with God, Peace and full aſſurance. <hi>Bleſſed be God.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 3. 1673. Sacrament, as alſo <hi>April</hi> 13. in both I was much enlarged, had ſweet peace, a good day. <hi>Ever bleſsed be God: Praiſe the Lord. And watch (O my Soul!) againſt paſſion, idle words, vain thoughts in Prayer.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome hints: But Oh that I had his enlargements upon them to impart! Surely theſe things are like ſmall Points and Marks in Maps that ſtand for Towns and Countries: But Spiritual Eyes can in theſe diſcern what Spirit Mr. <hi>John Hieron</hi> was off. A Man that lived near himſelf by Obſervation, and near God by Communion: A great receiver from God, and yet never ſo much as fingering any part of the Honour due to God.</p>

He was not found naked, but in the Ornaments of Chriſts Righteouſneſs and Grace; and therefore we may expreſs a confidence concerning him, that he is cloathed upon in his Soul with his Houſe from Heaven, and that his Duſt reſts, his Fleſh reſts in hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Non-Conformity caſt him out of the Publick Service of the National Church; but is no bar to his admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Heaven; for he did aſſent throughly, and conſent cordially to the Covenant of Grace.

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. MEthinks, I ſhould be greatly wanting to my Duty in writing this Life, if I ſhould not add ſomething by way of Improvement of it. I have endeavoured to make this good Man known to them, that knew him not; and to make him better and more fully known to them that knew him; but what is all this to the main purpoſe, if I ſhould not ſay ſomething to make him known for good, that we may be ſomething bettered by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? I have ever judged a Sermon lame, let the Doctrinal part be never ſo well handled, if it wanted its Application. I know this Narrative, that ſpeaks of him, ſpeaks to us; but alas who is not wanting to himſelf in Applicative knowledge! What a vaſt diſtance do many of us find betwixt our Heads and our Hearts? How little
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100845:21"/>
do we carry on of a practical deſign, in our reading of dead Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or in our hearing of the living Miniſters?</p>
               <p>The Man here mentioned (Reader,) is a part of the Cloud of Witneſſes, wherewith we are encompaſſed. Suffer me to do what I can to put ſome Life into this Life. I know I cannot do it; all quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comes from God; yet in Miniſterial Excitations God many times ſhews himſelf a quickening God: I will lay my Wood in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and wait for Heavens Fire: I will propheſie according to my ſlender proportion, and will hope for Gods commanding the Wind to blow, that brings the Breath of Life with it. I know every Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have written, or can write, is dead; but whilſt I am ſtirring up my ſelf and you, God can (if he ſo pleaſe) make words ſpirit of Life, make them quick and powerful. I fain would ſpeak, write nothing, but words of truth and ſoberneſs. I am ſenſible in ſome things I muſt ſay, I ſhall not pleaſe ſome; but I muſt pleaſe God, in uttering the deep thoughts of my heart upon this occaſion. Bear with me, ſuffer my heart to have a little vent. If you will interpret as charitably as (I hope) I mean honeſtly, you will take no offence at any thing that falls from my Pen, who have followed inoffenſiveneſs, ſo far as I could do it with faithfulneſs.</p>

Oh go not on to deny and decry the Office, and the Officers. Lay your hands upon your mouth. Ceaſe to vilifie Gods Miniſters, and the Miniſtry. Let your Ignorance drivel no more. Let your rancorous Minds vomit no more Reproaches. Let your ſpightful, envious Minds, full of malignity, belch out no more unſavoury, noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Language. Lo, here is a man that we offer to you as a proof of the Miniſtry. We have many ſuch as he. Our Quiver is full of ſuch, who make us not aſhamed to ſpeak to the enemies of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in the gate. Will you call Mr. <hi>John Hieron</hi> a Wolf, that did ſo feed the Church of God? Will you call him an Hireling, that Preached as many Sermons for nothing, as when he had his place; that made the Goſpel without charge? Will you call him a limb of Antichriſt, that was a pleader againſt <hi>Babylon?</hi> Will you Blaſpheme the Holy Ghoſt in the Gifts and Graces beſtowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on him, the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion? Will you ſay he caſt out Devils by <hi>Beelzebub?</hi> Will you queſtion his Call, that Heaven hath put ſo many

Seals to? Shall a Man of God be called a Prieſt of <hi>Baal?</hi> Shall a Prieſt cloathed with Salvation by God, be called by you a <hi>Chemarim?</hi> Do you ſeek a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in a man? Lo here it is! Do you not know, he was no reprobate; however he and others have been reprobated by you? Oh, return to more ſober Minds, and paſs a better Judgment on the Miniſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why will you be guilty of ſo great ingratitude, as to account this great gift of Chriſt as filth, off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring, refuſe? Why will you ſtrengthen the prejudices of a carnal corrupt World, againſt thoſe that would awaken and mend them? Why will you lend your mouths to Satan, to reproach the Servants of the moſt high God? For if your Language be not the hiſſing of the Serpent, I know not what is. Can wrath, clamour, bitterneſs, be from the Holy Spirit, who expreſly declares himſelf grieved by it? Do you not quench the Spirit, by deſpiſing Prophets, and teaching others to deſpiſe Propheſying? Whoſe Errand are you on? Whoſe deſign do you drive but Papiſts, who have transformed themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to various ſhapes; but agree in this, to wound the Miniſters? Whence do you fetch your Arguments againſt the Miniſtry; but from <hi>Socinians,</hi> which deny the Deity of Chriſt?

Give me leave, O you, that had an hand in contriving, in forming, in eſtabliſhing the Act of Uniformity, to ſhew you what manner of Men fell by it, and before it; the Man whoſe Character I have given you, and many of the ſame Spirit and Character, were driven out of their places by the Act of Uniformity, fled before the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act, and were all endangered, and many of them were malled by the Conventicle Act. What evil had they done? Surely, nothing that God had declared to be Sin; but what thoſe Acts made Crimes. Were the Penalties proportionate to the Crimes? Did you indeed ſpeak Righteouſneſs, O Congregation? Did ye indeed judge uprightly, O ye Sons of Men? Do you know what Spirit you were of, when you raiſed ſuch a Storm, ſuch a dry Wind, not to fan, nor to cleanſe the floor of Chaff; but to blow away the Wheat? When you threw this fire into the Sanctuary, where was your Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? From whence were your Politicks fetcht from, to begin ſo fiercely to lay the foundatons of reſtored Monarchy, and reſtored Prelacy in the civil death of ſo many, and diſobliging ſo conſiderable a number of the ſtanch men of this Kingdom, that had theſe Miniſters in thier
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100845:22"/>
hearts? Was this a winning way? Did this commend the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Church or State? What ſo dear to the ſober part of men in this Nation, as their good Miniſters? When men take them away, they are ready to ſay, what have we more? Better the Sun did not ſhine, then <hi>Chryſiſtome</hi> not Preach. Who can read love to a Nation in ruining of Synagogues? Brown bread with the Goſpel is better to ſerious Souls, then white bread without it; yea the bread and water of Affliction, is good fare to them that can ſee their Teachers: Oh that you ſhould ſtretch out your hands to vex certain of the Church! Such work ſhould be left to ſuch as <hi>Herod</hi> was. Why would you make ſo great a cry in the houſes of <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> Why would you put the praying ſeed to make ſo many complaints in Heaven to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt you? Why would no petitions for peace (ſo pathetick) move you? Why would no conſiderations of the mutability of Humane affairs, the ſight of the turnings of the wheel of Providence, the ſence of your own paſt ſufferings, which poſſibly might return again, ſoften you, moderate you? Why had you no proſpect of the evil that might be upon the Earth, to induce you to ſhew Mercy, and ſtore up Mercy for your ſelves againſt ſuch a time? Did you do as you would that men ſhould do to you? Oh, if into any of your hands, whom this Corollary concerns, this Book falls, I entreat you to give my words an impartial Reading, tread your violent ſteps back in great indulgence. If there be any thoughts of comprehenſion, let there be no ſnares. Let the Rules of Chriſtianity make it, we that are old, ſhall make no ſtrains of our Conſciences, we will lye in our Irons ſtill, knowing Death will ere long releaſe us; rather than have our liberty, by yielding to ſay or do things that cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great many diſtinctions. We deſire to be dealt plainly with, and to deal plainly with all the World. We are reſolved againſt all conditions that are ſinful; and we ſhall not willingly do any thing that is doubtful, or carries an appearance of evil, or may give any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſuſpicion, that we do depart from our Principles; we would advance in Reformation, and not be tempted to any retrograde ſteps. If you will lay the Bible betwixt us and you, it ſhall, like an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at <hi>Abel,</hi> end the matter. If our Bible lead us to you, we will follow it: We have heard of late dayes ſome ſpee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If any true remorſe do touch your hearts, you will become good <hi>Samaritains,</hi> and your kindneſs will exceed your rigours, you will pour into our wounds Oyl and Wine inſtead of Vinegar. Oh, I beſeech you think, (as I may allude to a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Hiſtorical paſſage) what manner of men you flew (civilly) at
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100845:23"/>
                     <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day: Lo, here I have preſented you with one, that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Apoſtles, the Evangeliſts, yea imitated the great Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls. This Man, and many ſuch you ſet aſide, the precious Sons of <hi>Zion,</hi> comparable to fine Gold, how were they eſteemed by you as Earthen pitchers? Yea, the <hi>Nazarites</hi> purer than Snow, whiter than Milk, more ruddy than Rubies, their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of Saphire; their Viſage made as black as a Coal by you, they are not known in the ſtreets; will you not remember the Battle, and do no more. Again, do not you ſee who have practiſed upon you, whoſe Agents you have been, whoſe hand is in theſe things? Have they not been ſervices to <hi>Rome,</hi> diſſervices to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> made her appear as a Stepmother to her beſt Children? As if ſhe was become cruel, like the Oſtriches in the Wilderneſs. Hath not this ſtrictneſs about Ceremonies been managed by Papiſts in diſguiſe? Have not the ſame hands inlarged that ſtrictneſs? And ſhall we ſtill go on? Is it not enough that you have done their jobbs, till they had like to have ſerved all our turns? (Bleſſed be that Providence that prevented it in the nick of time) but muſt we, will we go on now our eyes are openeed? Oh, work not with them, but counter-work them. Be not tenacious of what is theirs, caſt out their houſhold-ſtuff. Botch no more in Reformation, purge out the old leaven and let us be made a new lump: Let us keep the things wherein the Kingdom of Chriſt is, and part with thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is not. Take not of <hi>Babylon</hi> a ſtone for a corner, a ſtone for foundations, daſh her little ones againſt the ſtones. Let the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions go, wherewith the Kingdom of Chriſt comes not. Are all the ſignificant Ceremonies ſo ſignificant, as one Sermon of Mr. <hi>John Hierons?</hi> Have they that in them to excite, that energy, that Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial excitation hath? Where's the promiſe of Gods preſence with them, that the qualified, ſent, Miniſtry have and can plead? Were it not much better that (like <hi>Pollio's</hi> glaſſes) they were broken to pieces, than that one good mans mouth was ſtopt, becauſe he cannot ſwallow them? And further, are we ſo full of Miniſters, truly ſo called in <hi>England,</hi> that we can ſpare ſo many of our Labourers, and turn them off at once? Many thinking men judge a plurality of Miniſter's need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in moſt places, and know not how any Miniſter of Conſcience can accept plurality of places; but it ſeems you thought, there is ſuch plenty of Miniſters, as to disband ſo many good Souldiers was no loſs. When in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time ſhe was inſtigated by ſome ill affected to the Miniſtry, (very probably the diſguiſed Papiſts, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dr <hi>Burnet</hi> ſuggeſts) to abridge the number of Preachers; <hi>E. G.</hi> then Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was much troubled at it, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100845:23"/>
wrote a ſerious, zealous, learned, ſtrenuous, ſinewy Letter to her, urgeth the many hands uſed about <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, and many very pertinent Scriptures, to prove that the Goſpel ſhould be very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preached, and that plenty of Labourers ſhould be ſent into Gods Harveſt; ſo great and large, as that it requires not few, but many Labourers. Oh caſt your eyes upon that Letter, it may make you mourn for what you have done, and melt you into great tenderneſs. Furthermore, perceive you not how unproſperous your method hath been; ſee you not how you prevail nothing: If you thought to rip up the womb of Puritaniſm you have but made it more fruitful. There is ten of the Puritan perſwaſion for one formerly, (I wiſh though, that one of the ten were the true old Puritan). See you not ſince this Liberty what flocking there are to the Miniſtry? And if People were freely and fully at liberty to act according to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Inclinations, you would ſoon ſee a very great encreaſe of theſe numbers. See you not how many young men God hath raiſed? How he hath bleſſed their private Education? And what gifts they are enriched with? See you not, that Providence hath been inſtead of Livings to thoſe, whom you caſt out of Livings, drove from Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, from their kind Neighbours, entred Cautions againſt them in all wayes of Livelyhood that they were capable off, left many no way, unleſs they could dig in the Town-ditch? Ye dealt worſe with us, then <hi>Joſiah</hi> did with the Prieſts of high places: 2 <hi>Kings 23. 9. They did eat of the unleavened bread with their brethren;</hi> but for us, we muſt neither have Altar, nor Bread. The Prieſts of the high places had broken a poſitive Law of God; yet <hi>Joſiah</hi> moderated their puniſhment, though he ſhut them out from Spiritual Services; yet he allowed them Natural and Neceſſary Proviſions; I do not know that our crime was ſo great, but our puniſhment was greater. We found no ſuch moderation; yet we have found Mercy from God, we have turned no ſtones into bread. View our faces, we are fair liking; Mr. <hi>Hieron</hi> had an Eſtate, and God gave him an heart to live on it, and no need, nor mind to be burdenſome; and for others in meaner circumſtances, yet God hath abundantly bleſſed their proviſion, and hath ſatisfied his poor with Bread. Nay, let me cloſe this Corollary with that, which may moſt convince, and melt you, and make you ſmite upon your thigh; hath not God been near them? Hath not God met with them, whom you have caſt out of the Synagogues? Have not their parts been increaſed? Have not their Graces flouriſhed, hath not God ſpoken peace, and lift up the light of his countenance upon them? See you not in Mr. <hi>Hierons</hi> Life an intercourſe betwixt God and him? How did his beloved <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhow himſelf, yea, flouriſh thro' the latteſs.</p>

I preſume not to teach you; but I may be allowed to be your Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer: I may ſtir up your minds, and I do beſeech you mind his Qualifications for the Miniſtry, and labour you to be ſo qualified; this will make your inward call clear, and without that your outward call will afford your minds little ſatisfaction; nor can you with that confidence expect a Bleſſing. You have the ſame Father of Lights to go to. All his Gifts and Graces were borrowed. Where he borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his, you muſt borrow yours. If good men, much more a good God, is ever merciful and lendeth; he gives Wiſdom liberally, and upbraids not. You may light your candle, fetch fire to warm your heart from him, <hi>whoſe fire is in Zion, and furnace in Jeruſalem. Iſa.</hi> 31. 9. The better qualified, the more hopes of ſucceſs. Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beget us a Reverence in People. The Sanctuary Weights and Meaſures were bigger. Miniſters ſhould out-part their People, elſe they are diſdained. Qualifications approve the Miniſter a workman in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. God ordinarily works according to the aptneſs of means; good men full of the Spirit of God, have the preſence of God ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily moſt with them. I further exhort you to have an outward Call, the People have a right to choice, the Miniſtry a right to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, judge and ſeparate. The Magiſtrate may claim confirming. And oh that the Spirit of this Worthy Man was in us, that though he doubted not of his own Epiſcopal Ordination; ſo he queſtioned not Presbyterial Ordination: I wiſh moderation in this point. The Younger Clergy are very intemperate: But I pray you, if you do read what I write, conſider that they that are much Elder than you, are convinced by their Bibles, that a Biſhop and a Presbyter are the ſame Office. And let me add, they that have ſearched into true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100845:24"/>
and have perhaps read more Books, then either you, or I have ever heard of; dare aſſert, that they find no evidence of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Epiſcopacy. I ſhould much queſtion Epiſcopal Ordination, if Biſhops were not Presbyters. But above all, I deſire all Miniſters to mind and follow his Exerciſe of his Miniſtry; I have laid before you his Diligence, his Faithfulneſs, his Laboriouſneſs; I have ſhewed you how inſtant he was at home and abroad, Preaching in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. When he was fixt, he ſetled to his work; when toſſed, he was fixed for his work; throw him as men would, he fell upon his ſquare; he run all hazards, endured hardſhip as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt: O follow him. You find in his Life, that when he heard of Grace eminent in a Miniſter, or read of their Graces, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke himſelf to go and do likewiſe: So let Miniſters that read his Life, charge themſelves to Preach, as he did; Converſe profitably with your people, as he did; Admoniſh, Reprove, Exhort, as he did; endeavour to prepare People for the Sacrament, as he did. When his <hi>Breadſall</hi> Neighbours met frequently at the <hi>Smiths</hi> Shop, and there, as he feared, ſpent too much time unprofitably; he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, and would ſend a good Book amongſt them to read. Oh thus it is, ſay you to your own Souls, and thus it will be with them that have a care of Souls. I have repreſented to you his converſe with his own Heart, his looking to and keeping his own Vineyard. He was for ſaving himſelf, and thoſe that heard him. Oh be not you content to be as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ship-wrights. Remember the ſolicitude of Holy <hi>Paul, leaſt by any means when I have Preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt away. 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 27. He looked after his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; he liſtened not who commended his Sermons, but who made good uſe of them, bewailing the ſins of their hearts and lives. Not who, after his Sermons, cryed, how well hath he Preached; but how ill have I lived, what a vile carnal wretch am I? He longed for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſo do you travail in birth. Pray that your Sermons may be the Arrows of the Lords deliverance; that as the Row of <hi>Jonathan</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not back, as the Sword of <hi>Saul</hi> returned not empty; ſo it may be in your Spiritual Warfare. What ſhall I ſay to excite Miniſters? By long and ſad Experience I have found, I need it. I have had ſome reflecting thoughts upon that paſſage <hi>Iſa 42. 19. Who is blind, but my ſervant, or deaf as my meſſenger that I ſent? Who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lords ſervant?</hi> Do you think he did more than his Duty, more than needs? Sure you cannot think ſo, when you read <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. that a double [<hi>Take heed</hi>] is the Miniſters charge: Can you think it was more than needs, when Jeſus Chriſt ſpent his Blood for the flock? Can you think it more than Duty,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100845:25"/>
when a double dedication is upon you, your Baptiſmal Devotedneſs, and your Miniſterial Conſecration. Can you think it over-doing, when ſuch a Worthy as Arch-Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> breaths out his dying breath, <hi>O Lord, forgive my ſins of omiſſion?</hi> Can you think it more than needs, when you know the worth of Souls, the terror of having the Blood of Souls required at your hands? If he did not, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the ſame upon you and him. 2. Would you have Honour and Reſpect in your places, follow your work, as this faithful man did, Honour will follow you as it did him. <hi>Herod</hi> reverenced <hi>John.</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, he will honour you. Seek not the faces of men, fear not the faces of men, do nothing that may make men deſpiſe you, depart not out of the way, cauſe none to ſtumble at the Law, corrupt not the Covenant of <hi>Levi,</hi> be not partial in the Law; <hi>leſt God make you contemptible and baſe before all the people. Malachi</hi> 2. 8, 9. Fawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no body, flatter no body; fidelity commends it ſelf to Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. 3. Would you have his ſucceſs? He had a Seal in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of his Hearers, had Letters of Commendation; would you have ſo? Uſe no Leaden Daggers, but wield the Sword of the Spirit, let not the weapons of your Warfare be carnal; but thoſe that are mighty through God. He was an able Miniſter of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not of the Letter only. He was full of might by the Spirit of the Lord, drew the bow with his full ſtrength, did not do Gods work negligently, ſerved God with his Spirit in the Goſpel of his Son, and he was full of Souls given in; He will appear with a <hi>Lo! I, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren thou haſt given me.</hi> Be you travelling in your Souls, and you ſhall ſee of your travel and be ſatisfied; carry forth your ſeed weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, your boſoms ſhall be full of joyful ſheaves. 4. Would you have his peace, his viſits of God, his ſhines, his aſſiſtances, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in the way, his ſerenity, his ſatisfaction in the end? Follow his Integrity, mark this upright Man, tread after him in Zeal for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials, Moderation in doubtfuls, in Charity, Hoſpitality, in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the holy wiles of winning Souls, in loſing ſomething of your own to gain them, with meekneſs inſtructing oppoſers, reſtoring the lapſed, in puting your ſtronger hands under feeble hands, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>

                     <p>Remember what of a Chriſtian you ſaw in Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> and imitate him. Much of a Miniſter, much of a Chriſtian was with him. When his heart was dull, he went to ſome good lively Book, ſo do you. He went to Secret Prayer, and found God anſwering by Fire, ſo do you. He kept by him a Catalogue of Sins, to renew his Repentance for them before Sacraments, ſo do you. He had a Catalogue of Mercies, he looked back even to his Childhood, to ſtir up thankfulneſs, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thankfulneſs, herein follow him. He communed with his Heart in his Solitary Houres, he looked up his Evidences, and kept them fair, he entred proteſts againſt ſpecial Sins upon ſpecial occaſions, and took notice how he kept touch with God; follow him. He never met with any Experience either in a way of quickning, or comfort, but he made quick returns of Praiſe. Let every deſcent of Mercy return back in the quick aſcent of Praiſe: What ſhall I render? Was his queſtion; let that be more familiar with you. Teach your Tongues to praiſe, as ſome teach their Tongues to lye, and blaſpheme. He was a cloſe walker, an unblameable Converſation was with him, turn not you looſe Libertines, now his Eye inſpects you not, Gods doth.

And now my Pen is expreſſing my ſad thoughts about our great loſs of Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> let me lead my Reader a little further on; to weep upon the Graves of ſome other <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> Miniſters. Oh my <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> Friends, bear with me if I go on, and give my mind a little vent upon this doleful Subject. <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> is a beloved Country to me; I am no Native of it, but it being the Country wherein I began and ended my Publick Miniſtry, I am as it were Naturalized of it. By my great affections to it, my heart points towards it. And when I can breathe in that Air, and breathe out my ſelf amongſt them, I am refreſhed, and in my Element. I deſire my Limbs, that I might get over to them, and help them. Beſides, unworthy I am ſurvivor to divers of my Brethren there, their memory is precious to me. I cannot but build ſome little Monuments for them, and ſet them about this larger Monument of Mr. <hi>John Hieron;</hi> they wrought the work of God, as he did, they were his Companions in labour, his fellow Souldiers: They were driven into corners, lived in obſcurity, dyed in obſcurity, ſo far as men could cloud them, they were lights put under buſhels, but they were lights. Theſe Candles were not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, when men put them into dark Lanthorns; as the Bleſſed Jeſus, in his ſtate of Humiliation, his Deity in its Glorious Rayes did dart forth: So theſe Holy Servants of God did (as they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity) manifeſt their graces and gifts, though covered with a cloud by the juſt anger of God, (Adored be his Juſtice!) and by the cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſpleaſure of men (Curſed be their Wrath!) Theſe I think I am bound to give ſome ſhort account of.</p>
                  <p>To awaken my <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> Friends to bethink themſelves what a Miniſtry God hath bleſſed them with, and hath bereaved them off, it well becomes you, Oh my Friends, to reflect, whether you be Vines ſo flouriſhing, ſo fruitful, as anſwers ſuch Vine-dreſſers? Whether you were a Crown to them, that were a Crown to you? The ſtaple Commodities of your Country are Wooll and Lead: You are Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in theſe many of you, and are grown up to great conſiderable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let me tell you, the Miniſtry of <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> was a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous price than them. Your Shepherds were far beyond your
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100845:28"/>
Sheep. And thoſe Earthen Veſſels, your Miniſters, had ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of treaſure, as is of more value, then your rich Mines. Oh have you traded with them? You have cauſe to ſuſpect it, becauſe theſe Shepherds are ſmitten, theſe Veſſels are broken, theſe Mines fail, theſe Crowns are fallen from your heads. Again, I do it to enlarge thoſe ſhort hints in Mr. <hi>Hierons</hi> Life, wherein I have ſaid that we have not only him, a ſingle Miniſter to produce; but we have many like him in Parts, like him in Fidelity, like him in Laboriouſneſs, like him (though few equals to him) to ſhame the contemners, and to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the ſilencers of them. And laſtly, to preſerve their Names and Memories, and to provoke the Miniſters, that yet are in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to quit themſelves like Miniſters, to play the men for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of God, to emulate their gifts and graces; that ſo people may not be ſtraitened in their Miniſters, that the loſs of ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies may be leſſened, that the decay of the bearers of burdens may not wholly diſcourage, nor make the work to ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Let no offence be taken if I do not mention all. It is not diſreſpect to any good man; but only forgetfulneſs, and the want of ſome good Remembrancer at my Elbow: For I am in the ſtocks, ſhut up, cannot go out to others, and few have the kindneſs to come at me.</p>

He was outed from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington.</hi> A general Schollar; a great Maſter in the Tongues and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks.</hi> He had a Mechanical Head and Hand, capable of any thing, he had opportnity to get inſight into. I mention not his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity Education: For what ſome would reflect upon him, as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement, was really his great honour; that he was a man of ſo great Learning and worth, and yet beholden to no Univerſity for it. It is manifeſt to all that knew him, that he was a Judicious Divine, a good Caſuiſt, a workman in Preaching that needed not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, rightly dividing the Word of Truth, he was pertinent, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical, a man that was clear in opening his Text, and ſpake very cloſe to Conſcience from it. He knew well the inſide of Religion. Few that heard him, but they did diſcern his underſtanding of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſs, that he ſpake from his Heart, and they felt his words come to theirs. He was of few words and reſerved, not at all talkative; but give him but occaſion by ſtarting Diſcourſe, get him but upon his Knees, or put him upon Writing or Preaching work, and then you would ſoon find he wanted neither Words nor Senſe. Oh, he was a Man of Prayer; ſome dear ones that are left behind, and have had no ſmall burdens of Affliction ſince they loſt him, do feel the want of his Prayers, to lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees. He was of a very quiet Spirit; a people amongſt whom he laboured very ticcle, very capricious, very hard to be pleaſed in Miniſters, yet centered in him; and I am ſure his Name is precious amongſt them: And well he may; for I am ſure amongſt them, and ſome Neighbouring Meetings to them, he ſpent himſelf, and was ſpent by his great labours, in diſpencing Holy Myſteries, Word and Sacraments amongſt them. This good Man had many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves after he was outed, but God told his wanderings, and he had Songs in the Houſes of his Pilgrimage. At length he pitched at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freton,</hi> from whence he took many weary ſteps to ſerve his Maſter, and was very uſeful in that Neighbourhood; but at laſt was forced by his Infirmities to ceaſe from his Labours, and now reſts from them,

and thoſe works follow him. He hath built himſelf a laſting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his ſmall piece about the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> the ſubſtance of ſome Lectures at <hi>Wicksworth.</hi> And in his larger piece about <hi>Prayer:</hi> Thoſe things are diſcoveries of the Man: Yea, God hath built him a Monument in ſuch a ſet of Children, as God hath bleſſed few with, Mr. <hi>John Oldfield</hi> lives in three Sons of the Fathers Principles, actually in the Miniſtry, whoſe parts are above the common rate of moſt of their years, and their Piety, Zeal, and Induſtry anſwerable to their Parts. He dyed <hi>June</hi> 5. 1682. in the 55th. year of his Age.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> outed from <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> an ingenuous Man, ſtrict to his own well underſtood Principles, an accurate ſavoury Preacher, an exemplary walker, a Man elegant in every thing, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Reader, and obſerver of what he Read, ready with his Pen. Few men have left more excellent Collections behind them than he, which are happily fallen into his Sons hand, that knows well how to uſe them. His outward Bodily appearance was ſmall and mean, but he had a great Soul, rich in Grace and Gifts He left his place at <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> becauſe he could not keep his Place and his Peace, but he kept his Affections and Care over them; hazarded his Health and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſerve them. If <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> People would reflect upon his Labours amongſt them, and his warm Letters written to ſome of them, they muſt needs know that a Prophet was amongſt them, both able and faithful. The Pin of the Uniformity Act, driven by hands that were fit tools for ſuch miſchievous work, puſhed him out of his Pulpit and Houſe, and the hurricane of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act drove him from his hired Houſe and Town to <hi>Mansfield;</hi> in which he paſſed the reſidue of his ſojourning time in fear, wrought for the Salvation of others, and wrought out his own, was ever ſerious and laborious: But towards his latter end his Motion was very quick, made actual preparation for Death, deſired his poor outed Brethren, caſt into <hi>Mansfield,</hi> (as he was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to come together a little before his Death, to put him into the hands of God by Prayer, made a ſhort Confeſſion of his Faith in, and ſole dependance on the alone Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and not long after went full ſail into the Kingdom of God: He dyed <hi>May</hi> 30. 1683. He writ ſomething againſt <hi>Quakers,</hi> and Printed a Sermon with it, which gives the World a taſte of his Abilities. He lives in his Son, who bears his Fathers Name, and hath his Fathers Spirit, the true Son of ſuch a Father, filling up the vacancy by his Fathers death in Miniſterial Labours; in which (in my Judgment) he gives no juſt occaſion to any to deſpiſe his Youth.</p>

Mr. <hi>Luke Cranwell,</hi> born at <hi>Loughborough,</hi> in the County of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> Educated in <hi>Chriſts Colledge,</hi> outed from <hi>Peters</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Derby,</hi> a knowing, a couragious, zealous, and a very upright Man. Some now alive knew how deeply he engaged to reſtore Monarchy, but when reſtored it engaged not for him. He fell by the Decree of Uniformity, that ſpared not Age nor Parts, nor conſidered any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done, but levelled all that lay in its way, and ſpake no other Language, than <hi>bow or break.</hi> He was not very ready in Elocution; but very Scriptural, ſolid, and ſubſtantial in all his Diſcourſes; his Sermons when looked over by Writers, or thought over by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Hearers, were found to be full of Divinity; weighty and rational good matter filled them. He had ſome competent Skill in Phyſick before he was outed; and when he perceived, he muſt no longer trade his Miniſterial Talents publickly, he reſolved to try what he could do in his other faculty. Since he was cut off from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice of Souls, he betook himſelf to ſerve Bodies, (though not deſerting his Miniſtry, neither in his Affection, nor as to its Exerciſe). In this Imployment he grew preſently very Judicious, Skilful, Uſeful, and by Gods Bleſſing very Succeſsful. By this he maintained himſelf and his Family very comfortably, kept good Hoſpitality, did as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily help his Brethren, and the poor among his Neighbours, without any deſire or expectation of Fees, as he did the rich and greateſt. He had a working head. He underſtood well what he read, and did find out ſome Magiſtrals of his own; many happy and effectual Medicines. He was a chearful Man, and to appearance very ſtrong; but after he began to decline, he run down ſpeedily. His loſs was, and is much lamented: He was indeed a beloved Phyſitian. That he might be out of the reach of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act, he went to <hi>Kegworth</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and there lived and dyed <hi>Nov.</hi> 11. 1683. on the Lords day.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>Joſeph Moore, Nottingham</hi> born, Educated in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in the beſt dayes of that Colledge, when the truly Reverend, ſingularly Learned, and eminently Holy Dr. <hi>Tuckney</hi> preſided there, a Man fitted for wiſe and holy Government. He was ſober minded from his Youth. He entred young into the Miniſtry; but his Youth was not deſpicable; being grave, ſerious, and ſavoury. He was forced from his publick Miniſtry, which he exerciſed at <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diacre;</hi> by the Act of Uniformity, ſpent the reſidue of his time in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers private Families, in Praying, Preaching, Catechizing, all which he performed far beyond what might be expected from his years. He was an hard Student, a ſearching Man, a pertinent profitable Preacher, lived well, and dyed happily, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 27. 1684 Interred in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington</hi> Church.</p>

The two <hi>Stanyforths,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jonathan</hi> and Mr. <hi>Timothy,</hi> one ſerved Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel at <hi>Alleſtrey,</hi> the other at <hi>Hogneſton;</hi> both their mouths ſtopped by the Act of Uniformity. They were the Children of an Antient Godly Miniſter, and an eminently pious and found Mother. They were two good Men, gave much attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Reading, had a good Library. After their outing, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act, they were driven from pillar to poſt, yet I find that in all places they were at work, and the Lord gave them ſucceſs. I hope there are divers about <hi>Heage</hi> will bleſs God for their Night-labours. There are ſome that look white for the Harveſt, and ſeveral Families long, and follow after the Word. Theſe two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lived ſome years together, and dyed very near one to another. They made their laſt remove to an honeſt, but an obſcure Family: And from thence they took their flight one after another, from that obſcure corner to a lightſome and large place. They dyed both of them with much inward ſatisfaction, that they were going to that Heaven they had choſen and long laboured for. They had lively hopes in their dying Moments.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Mr. <hi>Samuel Hieron,</hi> Brother to Mr. <hi>John Hieron,</hi> made no great figure in the World, but was an honeſt man, and an uſeful Preacher; he had a room in the hearts of Gods people amongſt whom he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured. Few mens outward circumſtances more preſſed their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, than his did; yet he followed his Conſcience, and left a pretty Living at <hi>Shirley,</hi> upon <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24. 1662. and threw himſelf and all his, into the hands of Gods Providence. And though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from place to place, and every where met with hard penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths; yet he found God pityful, and of tender compaſſion; had enough to carry him to his Journeys end; and (through the workings of Gods good Providence) his, that he hath left behind him, I hope will not be expoſed to poverty, or coutempt. He dyed <hi>March</hi> 24. 1687.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Mr. <hi>Samuel Wright,</hi> outed at <hi>Heanor,</hi> a good Man, a very able Preacher: Lived in much weakneſs for divers years after his outing. He could not preach, as the reſt of his more healthful Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but when he did, he preached to very good purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Mr. <hi>John Bingham,</hi> outed from <hi>Marſton</hi> upon <hi>Dove.</hi> A Man of much Integrity, Zeal, and Faith; hearty for God, and in worſt of times and things kept up his heart, waiting for, and confidently expecting the Salvation of God. Thus he hoped to the end, and lived to ſee ſome dawnings of light, which he hoped would grow to a more perfect day; and ſo departed in peace.</p>

Mr. <hi>Joſeph Sweinam</hi> was not formally put out by the Act of Uniformity, but really he was, for foreſeeing that Acts commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day, he thought good to make a mixtly volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſeceſſion ſometime before its taking place, and ſo was not, and yet was expelled by it. He was a Man very well qualified to fill ſo auguſt a place as <hi>Allhallows</hi> in <hi>Derby,</hi> a very able Preacher, a great Maſter of Language, and lives in his Son Mr. <hi>Thomas Swetnam,</hi> whoſe abilities are well known by ſome few Sermons he hath Publiſhed, and by his frequent labours.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. I mention not divers driven out of the Country, men very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable; <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> Mr. <hi>R. M.</hi> Mr. <hi>S. C.</hi> who (though they be alive) yet are dead as to the Country and Places of their uſefulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I done ſomething to do my dear Brethren right, and pay my reſpects to them. And this I have done, partly to provoke others to do the like in other Countries, and eſpecially to ſtir up thoſe that are able to decypher the Brethren I have mentioned, or any of them; to write their Lives more fully than I have done. Partly to ſtir up <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> Chriſtians, to dear remembrances of their dead Miniſters; to reflect upon their Doctrine and Life, and to ſtir them up to a Duty (which I fear is much neglected) of viſiting their Fatherleſs and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in their diſtreſs. Read the Hiſtory, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. They were offered upon the ſacrifice and ſervice of your Faith; in ſome ſenſe you ought, (as <hi>David</hi> once did) Ask whether there be any of theirs who need your kindneſs, and ſhow the kindneſs of the Lord unto them, for their worthy Husbands, and Fathers ſake. Their love to you (like <hi>Jonathans</hi> to <hi>David</hi>) paſſed the love of Women. And furthermore to call upon you to adore and admire Gods goodneſs, that hath raiſed you up many young Men that preach, pray, and live at a great rate; that hold faſt, and hold forth the form of ſound words, which they have heard of Gods Servants in Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. Oh when you conſider this, Sing, becauſe ſo many are the Children of the deſolate Miniſtry. Their Rod hath bloſſomed, and brought forth Almonds: <hi>Say in your hearts, who hath begotten me theſe? Who hath brought up theſe, ſeeing I am deſolate, a captive, removing to and fro, left alone?</hi> Iſa. 49. 21. Oh you are not ſtraitened in Miniſters: Cry to God that you may not be ſtraitened in your own Bowels.</p>
                  <p>Yea laſtly, (If it were poſſible) to bring the rigid Men for Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to repent of their great ſin in compoſing and impoſing ſuch things, as ſtopped the mouths of ſuch Servants of God.

                        </gap>c ſunt Belli Decora;</hi> ſo I may ſay, when I have mentioned the outed Miniſtry, theſe are the Decencies, the Graces, the Triumphs, and Spoils of Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. What hath caſt away vilely the ſhields of the mighty? Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. What hath ſlain the Beauty of <hi>England,</hi> and made the mighty fall? Uniformity. What hath deſpoiled the neck of the Church like the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> builded for an Armoury, whereon their hangs a thouſand Bucklers, all ſhields of mighty men? Uniformity. When the very ingenious Eſquire <hi>Evelin,</hi> in his Book of Forreſt-Trees, mentions the goodly Oaks of <hi>England,</hi> he cannot forbear to pronounce his <hi>Dirae</hi> upon Iron Maſters, and Iron works in <hi>England,</hi> that have made ſuch waſts. I am for no imprecations, but expoſtulations with Men for rigid Uniformity. And give me leave to cloſe this Diſcourſe, by laying before you ſome ſober thoughts by way of Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Where do you find in Scripture a power given to man to make additions to Religious Worſhip? Do you not find the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in thoſe Scriptures; <hi>Deut. 4. 2. Deut. 12. 32. Prov.</hi> 30. 6. Who gave Man power to adopt unneceſſaries into Religion? What bottom ſtands Magiſterial Authority upon? Miniſterial Power is of God, but for this Magiſterial, it wants Commiſſion. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Is not the power of impoſing, as dark to thinking men, as the power of inventing? Whence did you learn to make burdens? Whence to lay them on, and bind them on? We are tempted to think your Maſters are, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 4. Hath God given you power over the Conſciences of men, to ranſack their Judgments, and wrack their Conſciences, to ruin all that cannot agree to your Sentiments, to undo all that cannot do what you will have them? Do you not in this ſtrike down the pin, upon which the Law and the Prophets hang? Would you that others ſhould do ſo to you? What ſtricture, or beam of right Reaſon leads you to make your Judgment the publick ſtandard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. What branch of Juſtice or Equity is there in ſo grievous Penalties for not conforming to ſuch Impoſitions. The fault is ſmall, if it be a fault. Should mens brains be knocked out, to kill a Fly on their forehead? But the Diſſenters judge it a Duty to witneſs againſt uſurpations of Men. They think they are bound by Gods Law to preſerve the purity of Chriſts Worſhip. They think that a yielding in ſome things was as a ſtirrop, by which Antichriſt got into the ſaddle. Are not theſe things judged by you indifferent? And muſt men be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100845:31"/>
puniſhed, as if they had denyed and razed the Fundamental Articles of Faith? Should you make men ſpectacles, the filth, and off-ſcouring of all things, upon theſe accounts? Who can read either Chriſtianity or Humanity in ſuch ſeverities?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. What awe can be impreſſed, or obligation faſtened on a well informed Conſcience, from Humane Laws eſtabliſhing, backing, and enforcing ſuch Impoſitions? Have not Magiſtrates ſupream and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, their Lines and Limits, Provinces and Bounds ſet them by the God of Heaven? Are they makers or only keepers of Gods Tables? Did the People of <hi>England</hi> truſt their Repreſentatives to make ſnares for their Miniſters and yokes for the People? Were they impowered by them to preſcribe, and write the grievouſneſs they had preſcribed? They were entruſted to be ſhields, not ſwords; healers, not woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; they ſaid to them, <hi>Let our ruins be under your hands;</hi> they never put themſelves into their hands to ruine them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. What Spirit are you of, when you make all Aſſemblies but your own, Seditious Conventicles, Schiſmatical Meetings, Routs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Riots? Know you not, that they which acknowledge God, are bound to aſſemble to worſhip him? Do you, can you think it is better not to worſhip God at all, then not to worſhip him in your way and mode? Dare you undertake that this ſhall hold in the day of Judgment? Are not you told by ſome great men of your own, <hi>That he that gives the cauſe of the Schiſm is the Schiſmatick?</hi> Do you think, thoſe you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed took themſelves to be diſofficed? Did their People deſert them, when you ejected them? Was the Word of Truth utterly taken out of the mouths you ſtopped? Was not Gods word in their hearts, as a burning fire ſhut up in their bones, ſo that they were weary of forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and could not ſtay? Did their Breaſts ake, and muſt they not draw them out to the Babes, that deſire the ſincere milk of the Word? You have ſome of you called Conventicles, <hi>the crying ſin of</hi> England: Oh! How crying a ſin is it in you that have occaſioned them; yea, neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them? A Natural Mother turned out of her own Houſe, will ſuckle her Child in the Field, or in the meaneſt coat, or ſhed ſhe can ſet her foot into. Corners are not our choice, but your force.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. Have not you cauſe to fear, that the blood of ſome of theſe dead Miniſters will be upon you? You judged them unworthy of the World, and God hath thereby been provoked to judge the World not worthy of them. You made their work much harder to them, and by their journeyings and faſtings, and watchings, in all likelyhood you did hurry and haſten them out of the World. Oh that ſome of us might live to ſee a relenting Spirit in you! It would be a joy to me, and a token for good to you, for otherwiſe I am greatly perſwaded Judgment is towards you, becauſe Mercy is the promiſed portion of the Merciful;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100845:32"/>
and Judgment without Mercy hangs over the heads of them that ſhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no Mercy.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I have finiſhed my Hiſtorical and Practical part of this Book: And ſhall conclude it with only adding one Chapter more in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to you ſome Letters written by this Eminent Servant of God Mr. <hi>John Hieron,</hi> which are as a Mirrour, wherein you may ſee the Ability and Fidelity of the Holy Man of God.</p>

                  <p>YOU deſire that I would write to you about your Spiritual Eſtate, which I take to be ſafe and comfortable, ſo far as one is able to paſs Judgment of another; <hi>But no man knoweth certainly the things of another, ſave the ſpirit of a man, which is in him. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 11. You are then to commune with your own heart, to ſearch and try your wayes, whether you walk after the Spirit, be led by the Spirit <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. 14. As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi> If you ask, <hi>How ſhall I know whether I am led by the Spirit? I Anſwer,</hi> If you bring forth the fruits of the Spirit, if you follow after Holineſs, ſincere Obedience to all Gods Commandments, patience in Affliction, love to God, Chriſt, all Saints, love to the Word, fear to offend God, a care to pleaſe God, and keep Conſcience pure and void of offence toward God and Man, Godly ſorrow for ſin, forſaking every evil way; and above all, believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, reſt upon him, truſt in his all-ſufficient ſatisfaction for pardon of Sin and Eternal Life. And all

this I doubt not but you do in ſome meaſure, ſo that you may conclude, as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. 1. There is therefore no condemuation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> May you not comfort your ſelf with theſe words? Do not hearken to Satans ſuggeſtions to the contrary, he is an Adverſary. If he cannot hinder your Salvation, he will do what he can to damp your joy and peace in believing. You ought not to give heed to him; but to repel him as our Saviour did, <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan.</hi> Your own unbelieving Heart (for Faith is mixed with unbelief even in Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) alſo will raiſe Objections againſt you thus: <hi>I have many Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in me, unruly Paſſions, I am haſty to Anger, Ignorant, have little Knowledge, conſidering the time and means I have enjoyed; I am dull in Duty, I Pray without any life or heat, I am cold in love to God and Jeſus Chriſt, I grow not in Grace, I am blockiſh, and remember nothing I hear:</hi> And many ſuch things you have to ſay againſt your ſelf. To which I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Grant all this to be true; Theſe are Sins of Infirmity, which may conſiſt with true Grace: <hi>Pſal. 40 12. David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My ſins are more then the hairs upon my head. Pſal. 73. 22. So fooliſh was I, and ignorant, even as a beaſt before thee.</hi> Read <hi>Heb. 5. 11, 12.

Conſider that none are juſtified or ſaved, becauſe they are ſinleſs, pure and perfect; <hi>but bleſſed are they whoſe ſins are forgiven. Pſal. 32. 1, 2. And to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs. Rom.</hi> 4. 5. What was the end of Chriſts coming but to take away ſin? <hi>Mat. 1. 21. Joh.</hi> 1. 29. Alſo a chief branch of the Covenant of Grace in <hi>Heb. 8. 12. I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs. And therefore be not faithleſs but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi> as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Thomas, John</hi> 20. 27, 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And let your heart make the ſame Anſwer, that he did, <hi>My Lord and my God.</hi> It may be, that your preſent condition is a grief to you, that you cannot wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God as you deſire, or as in your Health; you can do God no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Let not your heart be troubled at this; for God requires no more than he gives. And it may be no ſmall comfort to you, that you were diligent to attend upon God in your Health, and when you had Legs, you uſed them to Gods glory. And now you are ſerving God in another way, in the way of Paſſive Obedience, in which if you ſubmit to Gods will with Meekneſs and Patience, you may do God as good ſervice, as they that preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or travel far to the Word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

will conclude with thoſe ſweet words of Chriſt: <hi>John 14. 1. Let not your heart be troubled:</hi> Believe that God is yours, Chriſt is yours, the Covenant of Grace is yours, your Sins are forgiven, the Promiſes are yours, even the great Promiſe: 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 18. I will be a Father to you.</hi> And that alſo, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. We know that all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God; Even all the exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes in Chriſt; 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. which are yea and Amen, true and faithful. O bleſs God that ever you were born Spiritually, that you were born again. Say and ſing with <hi>David, Pſal. 103. 1. 2, 3. Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul!</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. at the latter end, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord ye righteous, and ſhout for joy all ye that are upright in heart. Pſal. 48. 14. This God is our God for ever and ever, he will be our guide unto death.</hi> And with the Church: <hi>Iſa. 25. 9. Lo this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us: This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad, and rejoyce in his Salvation.</hi> But I may ſave further labour, and indeed might have ſpared this pains; for you have a Book by you, which contains all that I now write, and much more to the ſame purpoſe. The ſcope and ſubſtance of it is to chear up and comfort poor Souls, that walk ſad and ſorrowful; when they have no other cauſe but to rejoyce and ſerve the Lord with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in which kind of ſervice the Lord is well pleaſed. I pray you peruſe it, and read it through, till you have got your Heart into a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frame. Now I pray, (and let it be your Dayly Prayer) <hi>That the God of Love fill you with Joy and Peace in believing, to whoſe Grace I commend you.</hi>

At other times, and in other caſes his Carriage was commendable. <hi>Pſal. 39. 9. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> If you ſay, this is not to the purpoſe, this cometh not home to the point, what comfort can you afford me touching my Sons Salvation, or what ground of hope? Here I confeſs I am at a loſs, and muſt ſay, as the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the poor Woman, crying, <hi>Help, O King.</hi> If the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee? If the Word yield thee no hope, or ſolid ground of Comfort, I ſhould but proffer flattery, and viſions of my own heart; if I ſhould offer to give Topicks of Comfort out of my own Invention. You are not without hope, that God might give him Repentance, to recover himſelf out of the ſnare of the Devil, if your intelligence be not to the contrary. There is place left for hope. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity often opens the eye that ſin had ſhut; as we ſee in <hi>Joſephs</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who had lain in their ſin above twenty years, without remorſe, till Affliction awakened them: The like we ſee in <hi>Manaſſes;</hi> when he was in affliction, he humbled himſelf, and beſought God, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of him, though he had been a prodigious ſinner. So the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Son by ſtraits, and other awakening afflictions, came to himſelf, and returned to his Fathers houſe. And the example of <hi>Rocheſters</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is remarkable. You cannot ſay you were ſure his Repentance was true; neither are you ſure of the contrary. So you are between hope and fear; let that keep you from deſpair. But ſuppoſe the worſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to uſe the words of <hi>Bildad</hi> to <hi>Job, If thy Children have ſinned againſt him, and he have caſt them away for their tranſgreſſions;</hi> (by the way this was a harſh cenſure) if it ſhould be thus, yet here is this Comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he dyed in his Youth, not a ſinner of an hundred years old, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If they be holden in cords of affliction, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them their work, their evil works, their tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded; (i. e.</hi>) gone beyond the bounds, which God ſetteth in his Word: <hi>He openeth their ear to diſcipline, and commandeth that they turn from iniquity.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe you find in <hi>Iſa. 27. 9. By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin.</hi> Agreeable hereunto hath been the practice of Gods people, to humble themſelves under Gods afflicting hand. <hi>Lam. 3. 39, 40. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſin? Let us ſearch, and try our wayes, and turn unto the Lord. Micah 7. 9. I will bear the indignation of the Lord becauſe I have ſinned against him. Pſal. 38. 18. I will declare mine iniquity, I will be ſorry for my ſin.</hi> Where this Duty is neglected God complaineth of them: <hi>Iſa. 9. 13. This people turneth not to him that ſmiteth them; neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts. Jer. 5. 3. Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved; (i. e.</hi> for their ſins) <hi>they have refuſed to return. Ch. 44. 10.

Job 33. 27. If any ſay I have ſinned, and perverted that which is right, and it profiteth me not, he will deliver his Soul from going into the pit.</hi> And this is the uſe you, and every one in your circumſtances, ſhould make of Gods Correction, to humble your ſelf under his mighty hand: To ſay as <hi>Job 34. 31.

To judge our ſelves: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. To examine our ſelves whether we be in the Faith, or no. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 5.

Abandon ill Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and all occaſions of ſin for the time to come; run not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but watch and pray, and keep your ſelf from your own iniquity. <hi>Pſal. 18. 23. If I regard iniquity in my heart, (i. e.</hi> allow my ſelf in any one ſin) <hi>God will not hear my prayer. Pſal. 66. 18. Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and offend in one point, (i. e.</hi> wittingly, knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) <hi>he is guilty of all;</hi> is obnoxious to condemnation, as if he had broken the whole Law. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. Let your future practice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſpeak the truth of your Repentance. And if you thus turn to God with your whole heart, make application to Chriſt by Faith, and his Bloud ſhall cleanſe you from all ſin: So God will receive you to Mercy, as the Father received the Prodigal Son with all expreſſion of Love. <hi>He that covereth his ſin ſhall not proſper; but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall find mercy. Prov.</hi> 22. 13. If you dare not ſet up a Judgment-ſeat in your own Heart, and keep a privy Seſſions in your own Conſcience, how will you appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, and give an account of all your Thoughts, Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the great day? For then muſt every one of us give account of himſelf to God. Then bleſſed are they whoſe ſins are forgiven: They may lift up their faces at that day with boldneſs, when impenitent ſinners ſhall be confounded, and call to the Rocks and Mountains to fall on them. They who live in ſin, are in danger to dye in ſin, and to be damned eternally for ſin. Sin will be ſure to find them out to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who will not now ſearch and find, and caſt it out by Repentance and amendment of Life. <hi>Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions; ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine. Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. Thus I have ſhewed you the good and right way to improve this preſent croſs, and to prevent worſe things. <hi>Joh. 5. 14. Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come to you.</hi> If God give you an heart to imbrace and hearken to this advice, you will have cauſe to ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 67, 71.

of Grace, that you will never caſt off your hopeful beginnings, nor turn aſide to crooked wayes; but continue ſtedfaſt in the good way you have taken up unto the end. The end is that which crowneth all good actions; and to perſeverance in well-doing are all the promiſes made. <hi>Rom. 2. 7. Mat. 10. 22. Rev.</hi> 21. 7. And our Baptiſmal Vow bindeth us to keep Gods Holy Will and Commandments all the dayes of our lives. Now that you have begun to forſake the broad way, that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deſtruction, and to enter into the ſtrait way that leadeth unto life; (O think what a Mercy it is, that God hath awakened you (with <hi>Mary</hi>) to chuſe the good part, that ſhall not be taken from you) you ſee the thing is feizable, and Godlineſs is not a thing impoſſible, if there be but a willing mind. If you ſhould now, or at any time hereafter fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it would not be a ſin of infirmity, becauſe you cannot help it; but of perverſeneſs, becauſe you will not be at the pains which a Godly life requireth: For uſe and acquaintance with a Chriſtian life makes it much more eaſie to you afterwards, then at the beginning. For the greateſt difficulty that is in a Godly life, is from cuſtom to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo that if after ſome acquaintance with it, when you have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much of the hardneſs of it you ſhould give it over, that would be utterly deſtructive. But I hope better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation, though I thus ſpeak. By all means be careful to ſet ſuch a watch over your ſelf, and ſo to avoid all occaſions and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as may preſerve you from all wilful breaches, and danger of Apoſtaſie. And becauſe by our own ſtrength we are not able to ſtand, ſee that you be much in ſecret Prayer. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6.

A work of Grace renewing the heart will make Chriſts yoke of Obedience eaſie, and his burden light, ſo his Commandments will not be grievous. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 3. It is by the help of the Spirit changing and ſanctifying the heart, that we mortifie the deeds of the fleſh. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. There may be an outward Reformation, where there is no inward work of Regeneration. So a man may be in the condition of the <hi>Scribes, Mark</hi> 12. 34. not far from the Kingdom of Heaven; yet never enter into it O wreſtle with God in Prayer, as for Mercy to pardon ſin paſt; ſo for Grace, and the Spirit of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to renew your heart, and to reform your life; that ſo you may walk before God to all well-pleaſing. If you would do ſo, continue inſtant in Prayer: <hi>Col. 4. 2. God will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask it. Luke</hi> 11. 13. Chriſt aſſures us, <hi>That whatſoever we ask in his name, the Father will grant.</hi> Thus you ſhall become a good Tree, bringing forth the good Fruits of Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the Praiſe and Glory of God, the Credit of the Goſpel, good

Yea, <hi>there will be joy in the preſence of the Angels of God over one ſinner that repenteth. Luk.</hi> 15. 10. So whether you live or dye, you ſhall be the Lords: And this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable at ſuch a time as this, when Sickneſs is ſo Epidemical, and many dye every where, and you your ſelf ſeem to be of no ſtrong Conſtitution, as it appears by your often Infirmities.

                  <p>I Fully purpoſed to have given you a Viſit; but hearing your Wife was ſo near her Travail I forbore till a fitter opportunity. And ſince I underſtand to my grief, that ſhe is delivered of two Children, both dead; and for which I am informed, you are much troubled; for which I cannot blame you, for the Providence is ſad: And a Chriſtian ſhould be a Man of Wiſdom, to ſee Gods Name written upon the Rod.

Example: <hi>John 18. 11. The cup which my Heavenly Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> And it was a very bitter one. Again, <hi>Now what I will, but what thou wilt.</hi> God is wiſer than Man, he is God only wiſe. We ſee but a little way, Gods underſtanding is infinite. Times are ill at preſent, they may be worſe; yea, ſo bad, that people may have cauſe to ſay, <hi>Luke 23. 29. Bleſſed are the barren, and the Womb that never bear, and the Paps which never gave ſuck.</hi> Yet if Children be a Bleſſing, as I grant they be in themſelves, and deſirable, there is no time over-paſſed; but you may have your Quiver full of ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, if God ſee it good for you: And if not, I hope you are more a Chriſtian, than to deſire them. Beware I beſeech you both, of the leaſt impatience in this caſe; and if any ſuch bitter root ſhould ſpring up in your hearts, check it, and chide it away, as <hi>Job</hi> did his Wives perverſe motion; ſaying, <hi>Shall we receive good at the hands of the Lord, and ſhall we not receive evil;</hi> But this I adviſe you, aſſoon as your Wife is ſtrengthened, appoint a ſolemn day of Humiliation, to entreat the favour of God, that this affliction may be ſanctified, and the anger of God (if you conceive he be diſpleaſed) may be turned away from you, and from your Family: Which having done, acquieſs in the good pleaſure of God; <hi>Let him do to you as to him ſeemeth beſt:</hi> So ſaid <hi>David</hi> in the like caſe, 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 25, 26. If I ſhall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee: Behold, here I am,</hi> &amp;c. This courſe a Kinſman of yours and ours, was adviſed to take after the death of all his firſt Children, and it pleaſed God to give iſſue, perfect Children; three at leaſt, that are all alive, Men and Women at this day. One may be too impetuous in his deſire of this, or the other Earthly Bleſſing, which deſire God may grant in Anger.

Be you very thankful to God, that hath ſpared the Tree; though the Fruit periſh. Reſign your Wills intirely to the Will of God, which is a wiſe, juſt, rational, gracious Will, who doth all things for the beſt to them that love him: Whereas our Wills are crooked, unjuſt, fooliſh, and oft unreaſonable.

I ſhall not play the Orator to make you a learned Speech, nor dreſs my words with Eloquence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to tickle and pleaſe you; but I ſhall write words of Truth and Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that upon a weighty errand, to which I requeſt your attention. How much better are the wounds of a friend, than the kiſſes of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The buſineſs of theſe lines is to deſire you to reflect with ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon your late piece of Juſtice in the conviction of thoſe good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who now by your means are ſentenced to ſuffer, as evil doers; when yet you can find no Occaſion againſt them, but what <hi>Daniel's</hi> Accuſers (who were Heathens) found againſt him, <hi>concerning the Law of his God. Dan.</hi> 6. 5. Pray weigh this your act in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and try if it will hold weight there. <hi>For we must all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelf to God. Rom.</hi> 14. 12. So then, if in this action you have dealt truly and ſincerely with God and his Houſe, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and take comfort in it. If as a Magiſtrate you have ſpoken righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>judged uprightly,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 1. If you have judged Gods People with righteouſneſs, if you have defended the poor and fatherleſs, if you have done juſtice to the afflicted and needy, if you have rid them out of the hand of the wicked, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 3, 4. then ſhall you have peace in your own conſcience, and a good reward at the reſurrection of the juſt, when God will reward every man according to his works. But if you have judged unjuſtly, and accepted the perſons of the wicked, if you have broken in pieces Gods people, and afflicted his heritage, if you have perſecuted Chriſt in his members, if you have hindered the progreſs of the Goſpel, and forbidden Miniſters to preach to people whereby they may be ſaved: <hi>then know that God ſtands in the Congregation of the mighty, he is Judge among the Gods, Pſal.</hi> 82. 1. He is among them to approve, protect, and reward them, if they judge righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he is among them, as a curious obſerver of their judgments; if they corrupt juſtice and turn righteouſneſs into gall, he will bring every of their works into judgment, and acquit ſuch as they condemn, and paſs a righteous Sentence upon their crooked and unjuſt cenſures. Magiſtrates are ſtiled Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 6. becauſe inveſted with Gods image above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, receive authority from God, and ſhould act for God, judge as God himſelf would judge. But ſeriouſly Sir, do you think, that when God the Son, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come to judge the quick and dead, that he (I ſay) will approve thoſe Judges, or Juſtices that paſſe Sentences and give out warrants to ſpoil Miniſters, and Chriſtians of their goods for preaching, praying, or hearing Sermons? Is preaching and praying now become an iniquity to be puniſhed by the judge? By a Chriſtian Mgieſtrate? <hi>The Apoſtle ſaith, wo be to me if I preach not the Goſpel;</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:100845:38"/>
but by ſuch manner of acting it ſhould ſeem to be quite contrary; wo to me if I do preach the goſpel. And as I have hitherto conſidered you as a Magiſtrate, ſo give me leave to look on you a little as a Chriſtian, and ſee how agreeable to the truth of Chriſtianity this act will appear, how well it becometh a Chriſtian Magiſtrate. Every Chriſtian ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Chriſts Kingdom, according to the Lords prayer, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> But ſuppreſſing of preaching is the direct means to overthrow Chriſts Kingdom, and to build up Satans. By theſe late actings, in which you lead the way, how many preachers have been ſilenced, how many hundreds of Sermons ſuppreſſed? by which who knows how many loſt Sheep might have been found, how many ſinners converted, Saints edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the eyes of many blind opened, dead Souls quickened and eternally ſayed? If it be ſo bleſſed a work to convert one ſinner, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 20. whoſe work is it to hinder ſinners converſion? What titles doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> give <hi>Elymas</hi> for an act of like nature, for endeavouring to hinder the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but of one Sermon, ſee <hi>Acts 13. 10. He that with-holdeth corn, people ſhall curſe him, Prov.</hi> 11. 26. much worſe do they who with-hold the bread of life from people. <hi>I was hungry and ye gave me no meat, Mat.</hi> 25. 42. Will Chriſt ſay to the wicked at the laſt day; but what will he ſay to oppreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Spoilers, Sons of violence; may he not ſay to them, I had a little meat, clothes, money, and ye took them from me? ſure, that is worſe; and worſt of all is taking away ſpiritual food. As the Soul is more excellent than the Body ſo much worſe is it to take away the bread of life, far worſe, than to take away corporal food. Pray conſider how in conſiſtent this is with love to God and Chriſt, which all Chriſtians profeſs. <hi>Joh. 21. 15, 17. Peter,</hi> loveſt thou me? feed my lambs, feed my ſheep. A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter can no way better teſtify his love to Chriſt, than by diligent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful feeding the flock with ſincere milk of the word, nor a Magiſtrate, than by incouraging the faithful diſpenſers of the word; whom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and puniſh for doing their duty, how highly diſpleaſing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to the Lord is ſuch an act? who rebuked even Kings for their ſakes, ſaying <hi>do my Prophets no harm, Pſal.</hi> 105 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor can you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge juſtly, that you puniſh them not for preaching and hearing, but for tranſgreſſing the law, when you know, they have authority both to preach and hear by his Majeſty's Declaration and Licenſe under his hand and Seal; yea and a Bill of eaſe is under conſideration of this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment to juſtify their proceedings. And doth it become inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to interpoſe, or rather to oppoſe that Indulgence; which both King and Parliament have thought meet to grant? Nor need you to fear the loſs of an hundred pounds, in caſe you had refuſed to act. For men of judgment are of Opinion, that the forfeiture is not at all reoverable in Law. And if it were, what Informer dare contend with you for it? But ſuppoſe the worſt, read 2 <hi>Chron. 25. 9. What ſhall we do for the hundred

Talents?</hi> The Lord is able to give thee much more than this. Oh how vile a thing is the love of money, 1. <hi>Tim. 6. 9. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him, 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 15. I will not be ſo uncharitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, as not to hope and believe, that you love Jeſus Chriſt really; yet if you love the world, <hi>i. e.</hi> money, eſteem credit or any thing in the world above Chriſt, you love him not ſincerely; <hi>Mat. 10. 37. He that loveth Father, or Mother</hi> &amp;c. <hi>more than me, is not worthy of me,</hi> is no good Chriſtian. <hi>Give me leave to cite one paſſage out of Mr. Baxter—In Q.</hi> Mary's <hi>days, when Martyrs were condemned to the fire, there were many great men, who really loved them, and wiſhed them well, and their hearts grieved in pity for them, as knowing them to be in the right. But they loved their honour, wealth, and ſafety ſo much better, that they would ſit on the Bench, yea, and give Sentence for their burning, for fear of hazarding their worldly happineſs, was this ſincere love,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Saints reſt. p. 3. pag. 238.</p>
                  <p>Say not theſe men under conviction are Diſſenters, Phanaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not hazard my reputation to be eſteemed a favourer of ſuch. You know Chriſtianity hath ever been reproached, and hath ſuffered under black names. Chriſt himſelf was blaſted with the odious name of <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane.</hi> His Apoſtles and the firſt Chriſtians were termed the ſect of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarenes,</hi> of which <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was counted the Ringleader, <hi>Acts.</hi> 24. 5. an Heretick, <hi>v.</hi> 14. The Chriſtians of former ages in <hi>England</hi> were called <hi>Lollards</hi> Hereticks <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in our age Puritans, Phanaticks. But what if Chriſt own them for his people and members, whom the world proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes with odious titles? What a caſe are they in then, that vex and ſpoil them of their goods? What if you had been ill thought of by ſome vile perſons (for wicked men are vile, <hi>Pſal. 15. 4. Dan.</hi> 11. 21.) you ſhould the more be had in reputation of wiſe and good men. To be diſpraiſed and diſparaged by lewd men, is no diſgrace, but a commendation; yea, God himſelf will honour them that honour him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. But Chriſt will be aſhamed of them that are aſhamed of him, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38.

kingdom by ſurppreſſing the Goſpel? What evil hath the Goſpel of Chriſt done? That the preacher of it, the profeſſors of it ſhould be thus deſpightfully uſed by the world, by profeſſing Chriſtians; What account can I render to the Lord of this, when it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>give account of thy Stewardſhip, for thou maiſt be no longer Steward?</hi> Should I, that was looked upon with much reſpect by all ſober Chriſtians be the firſt of all thoſe of my rank, and the leading Man in that action, which tends direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the pulling down the walls of Gods <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and make the builders thereof to <hi>ceaſe by force and power,</hi> which was the work of Heathens and enemies to Religion? <hi>Ezra 4. 23. 24.

Surely it is becauſe I honour you, as not only a Gentleman but a Chriſtian; one who have good things in you, and a Conſcience bearing witneſs to the truth, and will not rebel againſt the light, when it ſhines out, but will yield an obedient ear, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal. 141. 5.

And if it pleaſe God to open your eyes, and touch your heart, then it will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you, that you hearkened to the counſel of a poor Miniſter, but you will bleſs God for it (as <hi>David</hi> did for <hi>Abigails</hi> advice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32.)

                  <p>IT is now a long time ſince I ſaw you: But to me no little grief; I hear an evil report of your lewd and ungodly courſe of life, that you lead, to the great diſhonour of God, the grief of your Friends, the danger of your Immortal Soul, and the ruine of your Family, whom by waſting, and your unthrifty courſes, you muſt needs bring to Poverty here, and hazard their Eternal Salvation hereafter, by your ill example, and neglect of honouring and worſhiping of God in your Family, as every Chriſtian is bound to do. Now I pray you conſider your wayes; whether is Alehouſe haunting, keeping company with Drunkards, caſting off Prayer and all Family Duties, the way to Heaven or Hell? Is this to walk as the Goſpel teacheth, Soberly, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, Godly in this preſent evil World? Is this to follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Godly Education of your pious Friends, who brought you up in the fear of God? Is this to walk according to the Vow of your Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in which you were dedicated to the ſervice of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and in which you promiſed to forſake the Devil and all his works, the vanities of the World, and the luſts of the Fleſh? Pray, think how great a ſin Perjury is, to be forſworn by breaking a ſolemn Vow made to God in the face of a Congregation, which God will require at your hands? And how fearful a ſin is Apoſtacy, to fall away from your holy profeſſion, which ſometime you made. Read, and tremble at thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Prov. 14. 14. 2 Pet. 2. 20. 21. Heb.</hi> 10. 29. Will the pleaſure of ſin for a ſeaſon make you amends for the loſs of Heaven and Eternal Happineſs? Can your good fellows and companions in wickedneſs ſave you from the wrath of God, and the vengeance of eternal fire? Will they, or can they comfort you in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at the hour of Death or day of Judgment? Did the rich man <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 28. think that his Brethrens company would be any ſolace to

him in Hell? Why then doth he requeſt ſo earneſtly, that a Preacher might be ſent to warn them, that they might turn and eſcape the place of torment? Lay theſe things to heart, and remember your ſelf in time, before it be too late. And as with the prodigal Son you have run away from your Fathers houſe, and from your Duty; ſo return with him to your Obedience. Confeſs and bewail your ſins to God, as he did, and forſake them and you ſhall find mercy, as he did. But do it betime without delay, defer it not; leſt your heart be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, or leaſt death come upon you unawares. And if you dye in your ſins, Hell follows after. Abandon the Alehouſe and all wicked company, ſet up Religion in your Family, pray not only once on a Sabbath day, (I marvel where you learnt that) but every day morning and night; and break off all your ſins by Repentance, and pray for a new heart; <hi>for why will ye dye?

                  <p>Now I ſpeak to your Son: Though God does ſometimes viſit the iniquity of Parents upon Children; yet there is none upon Earth ſo juſt, or innocent, as to be Naturally pure, and free from ſin. All are born in ſin. The imagination of the Heart of Man is evil from his youth. You are therefore to be humbled for Original Sin, the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Nature, the Mother of all abominations. And pray, that you may be born again with a new birth from Heaven. <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>Pſal. 51. 5. Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> Every one therefore muſt be renewed; taken off the ſtock of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and ingraſſed into Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17. If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> Make ſure of this, that you be in Chriſt. In him God is well pleaſed, and with all that are in Chriſt. If you may ſay with <hi>David, Pſal. 118. 6, 7. The Lord is on my ſide, I will not fear what men,</hi> or Devils, <hi>can do unto me: The Lord taketh my part with them that help me.</hi> Again, <hi>Pſal. 56. 11. In God I put my truſt, I will not fear what man can do unto me. Pſal. 27. 1. The Lord is my light, and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear? The Lord is my ſtrength, of whom ſhall I be afraid? Rom. 8. 31. If God be for us, who can be againſt us? He that ſpared not his own Son,</hi> &amp;c. Make ſure of Gods love, and then you need not fear the Devils malice. For firſt, the Devil is a conquered Foe. He is a Dragon, or Lyon in chains. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 1. Chriſt that owns the Croſs hath overcome and ſubdued him. <hi>Heb. 2. 14. Through his death he hath deſtroyed him that had power of death, that is the Devil.</hi> He cannot go one link beyond his Chain. He could not touch one Lamb of all <hi>Jobs</hi> flock, till God gave him leave He could not enter into the Herd of Swine till Chriſt permitted him. He cannot appear to you, nor hurt you, except God ſuffer him. <hi>The very hairs of your head are all numbered. Matth.</hi> 10. 30. By fearing him, you do him too much pleaſure and honour: And will you pleaſure a cruel enemy? An enemy to God and your Soul By ſo doing you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God and Chriſt, who is your ſtrength and Redeemer. You do

in effect ſay, I doubt the Devil is too hard for God. I fear God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver me out of his hands. Whereas it is promiſed, <hi>Rom. 16. 20. The God of peace ſhall tread Satan under your feet ſhortly. 1 Joh. 4. 4. Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</hi> How fooliſh a thing is it to fear that which never did befal you, nor any man, not one of ten thouſand? What, did you ſee the Devil, or have you known one man or woman, that ever did ſee him; except Witches who call him in to their aſſiſtance? His ſuggeſtions, or temptations cannot harm you; but moleſt and trouble you. They are not your ſins, you may ſtill keep your integrity for all them, as <hi>Job</hi> and Chriſt did. And if God ſhould ſuffer him to appear to you; yea, and carry your Body from place to place, as he did our Saviour; yet it is not in his power to hurt you. I have read of a Godly Miniſter, that for want of a better, was forced to dwell in a Houſe that was haunted, and one night when he was in Bed the Devil appear'd to him, ſtanding like a Man at his Beds feet: The Miniſter ſaw him, but was not affrighted; only ſaid to him, <hi>If thou have nought elſe to do, thou mayeſt ſtand there ſtill, I will betake my ſelf to my reſt;</hi> and ſo he did, and heard no more of his gueſt. The Devil is a proud Spirit, and loveth to domineer, and have men ſtand in awe of him, to fear him inſtead of God, and this he triumpheth in. But the beſt way is to ſlight and contemn him, as the Miniſter did; ſo ſhall you be ſooner rid of him.</p>
                  <p>Leave thinking of him, and have God more in your mind; his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Love, and Care to all that fear him; his Promiſes, Providence: Theſe call to mind Gods Attributes, his Allſufficiency, his Almighty Power. <hi>I am the almighty God; Gen.</hi> 17. 1. and <hi>Gen. 15. 1.

may without doubt, be well aſſured, your Eſtate is good and ſafe. For you could not have choſen God, and loved Chriſt, unleſs he had choſen and loved you firſt. Dwell therefore in the thoughts, and taſtes of Gods love to you. Say, how wonderful is Gods love to a poor worm and ſilly duſt! That the contrivance of infinite wiſdom ſhould be taken up about me! That the eternall Deity ſhould conſult about my ſalvation, ere the world began! That God ſhould paſs by many wiſe men after the fleſh, many mighty, and noble, (who if they had been converted, might have done God better ſervice an hundred times then I) and make choiſe of me, a diſpicable ſinner, to be an Heir of ſalvation. Lord what is man <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus raiſe up your heart in thankful admiration of Gods wonderful love to your Soul. And Thirdly the aſſurance of Gods love will incourage your heart againſt the fear of death, and give you confidence againſt the King of terrors. I ſhall be glad to hear of your recovery; though I thus write, I commend you to God, and if I never ſee you in this world, I hope to meet you with other dear friends, who are gone before, in thoſe manſions, which Chriſt hath purchaſed, and prepared for all thoſe that love him, to whoſe grace I refer you,</p>

You have the Well of Water in you ſpringing up to Eternal Life; you have Chriſt in you, the hope of Glory; but your eyes are held, that you perceive him not. Like thoſe two Diſciples, that went to <hi>Emanus, Luk.</hi> 24. 16. You are in Chriſt, there is no curſe, condemnation, or wrath to come belonging to you, you are waſhed, you are ſanctified, you are juſtified in the name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God. All things are yours, Chriſt with all his benefits, the Covenant of Grace with all its priviledges, all the great and precious promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which are yea, and Amen in Chriſt, ſealed in his Blood, confirmed to you in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. God is your God, your loving Father in Chriſt. Heaven and Eternal Life is yours. <hi>Fear not poor Soul; it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> What ſhall I ſay more? What can you deſire more; except you would have your name put into the Scripture promiſes? You believe you ſhall dye, becauſe <hi>it is appointed for all men once to dye;</hi> your Name is not there. You believe the Reſurrection of the Body; becauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>There ſhall be a reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt;</hi> yet your Name is not there. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever believeth in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved: i. e.</hi> Whoſoever being truly humbled for ſin, diſclaims all opinion of his own Righteouſneſs, and with <hi>Paul,</hi> deſireth to be found in his Righteouſneſs only, he truly believeth: And ſo do you; therefore you ſhall certainly be ſaved. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall find mercy. Whoſo loveth God, the ſame is beloved of God. Prov. 8. 17.

It's the common lot of all Chriſtians to ſuffer Afflictions outward or inward, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both: 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 5.

Believe his Promiſes, believe his Prophets; <hi>ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed: 2 Chron.</hi> 20. 20. Beware of entertaining hard thoughts of God, dark miſgiving thoughts, as you ſeem to do, when you fear leſt God ſwear in his wrath againſt you; he did ſo againſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, rebellious <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who deſpiſed the pleaſant Land, and would appoint a Captain to lead them back into <hi>Egypt.</hi> What is this to your caſe?

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100845:45"/>
mutual Sealing on both parts. You put to your Seal, that you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, with his yoke of Obedience, with his Croſs, Perſecution. Did you not mean thus ſincerely, with a good and honeſt heart? This is your Covenanting for your part, which you will indeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form faithfully all the dayes of your life; though in many things you fail; as in vain thoughts and divers other things.

Now is not here ſtrong Conſolation for a Believer, an Heir of the Promiſes, one of Gods Covenant people? Away then with all doubtiug and unbelief. God is a faithful God; he keepeth Covenant and Mercy with them that love him, and keep his Commandments. Can you deſire better aſſurance, that God is your God, Chriſt is your Saviour, that your Sins are forgiven. That is one branch of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. This Covenant is an everlaſting Covenant, ratified and confirmed by the Bloud of Chriſt; and the Seal of the Sacrament.

You have requeſted a ſhare in my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that was your own expreſſion in a letter from you above twenty years ago. You have been a great promoter of Religion by your pains, and purſe, and conſtant endeavour to get a good Miniſter ſetled at the place where you live. You have been reputed a ſober man, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100845:45"/>
a godly Chriſtian by all that knew you. Thus you did run well. You were in a right courſe, you were fair for the Kingdom of Heaven. But how is it with you now? It is no good report that I hear of you; you are I hear become an Ale houſe hanter a company keeper; Can ſit and tipple with drunkards; Seem to take delight in bad fellowſhip; Elſe you would not viſit the Ale-houſe ſeveral times in a day, and neglect your buſineſs at home; you decline in goodneſs, and decay in your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate. If this witneſs be true, as I am credibly informed, then are you to be ſharply rebuked, that you may be ſound in the faith. O fooliſh man, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth; you did run well; who did hinder you; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun in the ſpirit, are you now made perfect in the fleſh; Have you done and ſuffered ſo many things in vain; if it be yet in vain? Thus you loſe the things you have wrought, and fall ſhort of the reward of godlineſs for want of perſeverance, and holding out to the end. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I pray you, whence you are fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works. You had better not to have known the way of righteouſs, then after you have known it, to turn aſide from the holy Commandment delivered to you; better not to have been waſhed, then return to the wallowing in the mire, and lick up your vomit again. Apoſtacy is ſo fearful a ſin, that I tremble to think of the heinouſneſs of it; how many woes and threatnings are upon record in ſcripture. Read and tremble: <hi>Prov 14. 14 Pſal. 101. 3. 125. 5. Ezek. 16. 24 33. 13. Heb. 6. 6. 10. 26. 39. 2 Pet. 2. 20 21. Mat.</hi> 2. 45. What iniquity have you found in the ways of God, that you have forſaken the good path, the holy Brethren for the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon: for you cannot ſerve two Maſters. You cannot keep integrity, and take pleaſure in ſinful courſes, which are as contrary as light and darkneſs, fire and water. By your preſent practiſe, you proclame to world, that you upon long experience, and having made tryal of Religious courſes find no profit, no comfort in them. And ſo renounce your part in God and Chriſt, heaven and happineſs, and reſolve to take your lot and portion with drunkards, and ungodly ſiners, both in this world, and that which is to come. Do you tremble at ſuch a thought? This is the language of your Ale-houſe hanting. O what diſhonour is this to God, that one that hath been his Servant ſo many years, ſhould now at laſt revolt from him, and turn on the Devils ſide, and to profeſſe to like the Devil better then God; his work, better then Gods; his wages, better then God; hell, better then heaven; the company of Drunkards, better then the ſociety of Saints! For a Chriſtian to turn Drunkard is the worſt turn that can be. If you conceive this charge be to heavie, conſider, that God makes no difference between drunkards, and the companions of drunkards. Compare, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 44. and <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 41. To ſit, to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100845:46"/>
eat and drink with the drunkard, is all one with to eat and drink and to be drunken; And the puniſhment of both is alike; <hi>The Lord of that Servant will come in an hour when he looketh not for him, and ſhall cut him aſunder and appoint him his portion with hypocrites: there ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth:</hi> So in <hi>Prov. 23. 20. 21. Be not among wine bibbers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the drunkard ſhall come to poverty.</hi> By which it is plain that it is all one to be among wine bibbers, and to be a drunkard; keeping company with wicked men is forbiden as well as wickedneſs it ſelf. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 1. A godly man, who is the only bleſſed man, is one that hath no fellowſhip with the ungodly, <hi>Pſal. 26. 4. 5. I have not ſat with vain perſons, neither will I go in with deſemblers, I have hated the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of evil doers, and will not ſit with the wicked. Prov. 13. 20. He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhall be wiſe: but a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed. Pſal. 119. 63. I am a compainon to them that fear thee.</hi> I need not multiply texts in ſo plain a caſe: And do I need to add, how offenſive Ale-houſe hanting is to others? It brings reproach upon profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it verifies the prophane proverb, a young Saint, an old devil; it gives occaſion to the adverſary to blaſpheme; it rejoyceth the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hardeneth their hearts, and ſtrengtheneth their hands, that they ſhould not return from their lewd ways. It grieveth the good ſpirit of God, it makes ſad the hearts of thoſe that fear God, it is a ſore affliction to your Wiſe, family, and relations, it impoveriſheth your Eſtate, cauſeth a neglect of your buſineſs and calling, it unfits you for holy duties, though you do not altogether lay them aſide. If you regard iniquity in your hearts? God will not hear your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he heareth not ſinners, that is not ſuch as live in ſin; for in prayer we are commanded to lift up holy hands: 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 2. 8. Lay all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ballance of the Sanctuary. Weigh your Actions. Do I well to turn from my Righteouſneſs, and commit Iniquity? Do I well to forſake God the fountain of living water, and to dig to my ſelf bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ciſterns, that can hold no water?

Be not ſo unwiſe as to make light of Eternal Happineſs, by giving way to Alehouſe mirth and merryment; which is a poor remedy, and to be ſorrowed for with bitter tears: <hi>Prov. 14. 13.

Repent, and be converted, and return to God, from whom you are deeply revolted; bewail your backſliding, forſake your evil courſes; <hi>Enter not into the path of the wicked: Prov.</hi> 4. 14, 15. Pray, lie at the Throne of Grace, beſeech God with importunity, beg pardon for what is paſt, and Grace to keep you from the path of the deſtroyer for the time to come. Break off from all ill company.

Prov. 28. 13. Iſa. 1. 16, 18. 1 Joh. 1. 7. Pſal. 130. 4, 6. I will heal their backſliding. Hoſ. 14. 4. Jer.</hi> 12.

                  <p>Becauſe I have nothing to write to you about worldly matters, I would give you a word of ſpiritual advice; which as it is not to me any trouble; ſo I would hope, it is neither unprofitable, nor unaceptable to you.

One actual ſin is enough to deſtroy a man as is apparent in <hi>Adam, Lots</hi> Wife, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphir a,</hi> And many others in ſcripture; and how much more then will a courſe of ſin, a way of wickedneſs, as the love of the world, a form of godlineſs, hypocriſie, an unregenerate eſtate, if continued in, undo a man everlaſtingly? Yet how little is this laid to heart? What favourable thoughts do moſt people entertain of ſin? As if it were at light matter, not to be ſo much dreaded; ſince Chriſt died for ſin, what need we ſo much fear to live in it? Seeing God is merciful, why may not we take liberty to live as we liſt? As if the Son of God came down from Heaven not deſtroy the works of the Devil; but to eſtabliſh the Empire of ſin, as if God were not as juſt, as merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; whoſe moſt pure and holy nature can never be reconciled to ſin. Sin is the tranſgreſſion of law. And the great Lawgiver, who is able to ſave, or deſtroy, will never ſuffer ſinners to trample on his authority, and caſt his Commandments at their heels, and hold them guiltleſs. Sin provoketh God, the God of patience to anger. And the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt ſin in all ages.

If it ſhould pleaſe God to make a greater breach among us by taking from any of us a dear friend, we ought to ſubmit to Gods will with patience and ſilence. As we ſee in <hi>Job,</hi> who beſide the loſs of all his cattle, had all his Children at mans eſtate taken from him by a violent ſtroak, yet how religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he behaved himſelf, under the hand of God you may read in his ſtory. <hi>So let us humble our ſelves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt us in due time: 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 6.

But I would not have you too earneſtly ſet your hearts upon any outward bleſſing, nor too eagerly deſire iſſue; but with ſubmiſſion to Gods will, ſo far as may be for his glory, and your good and comfort. <hi>For though Children are an heritage from the Lord,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 3. that is, when God giveth them in love, and bleſſeth them; not when he giveth them in anger, as he gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> quails <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 30, 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gave to <hi>Ephraim</hi> Children <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9 13. for the murtherer: Better it is to be barren, then fruitful in Children, that may be croſſes to fathers, and heart break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to Mothers by their wickedneſs <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 25. or by the evil of the times.

Time is irrevocable: When once it is paſt, it cannot be recalled; not if you would give thouſands of Gold and Silver for one day or hour longer. Let every paſſing peal you hear ring, every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grave you ſee opened, preach to you this Doctrine; <hi>Be ye alſo ready.</hi> Thoſe to whom thoſe Skulls and Bones you ſee turned up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, were in their time, as good Men as you perhaps. What we ſee them to be now, others will ſee us to be ſhortly. The faſhion of this World paſſeth away; but Godlineſs, Grace, Holineſs, endureth for ever. Chooſe with <hi>Mary</hi> that good part which ſhall never be taken from you. I know no buſineſs of greater weight than this is, therefore I beſeech you do not ſlight it, but lay it to heart. Thus with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to you, I reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>THE only intent of this Paper is to give you a word of Spiritual Advice and Direction to carry your ſelf ſo in this World, that you may be happy for ever in the World to come. You know every one hath a Soul, an Immortal Soul, which muſt live <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Only take heed to thy ſelf, and keep thy Soul diligently.</hi> The more precious any thing is, the more careful we are to preſerve it, and more fearful to loſe it. In this reſpect the Soul deſerves more care,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100845:50"/>
than all the things in the World beſides; for it is infinitely more worth. <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and looſe his own ſoul? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> Saith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 26. Wherefore let my Counſel be acceptable to you, and I will ſhew you the right way, how you may ſave your Soul, and be for ever happy; which I ſhall do in two words. Firſt, Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſhun and avoid whatſoever is deſtructive, and dangerous to the Soul; and that is ſin, and ſinful luſts. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 11. Abſtain from fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts which war againſt the ſoul. Dent. 23. 9. Keep thee from every wicked thing. Jer. 44. 4.

He that walketh with the wife,</hi> (that is the Godly) <hi>ſhall be wiſe: But a companion of fools</hi> (that is, of wicked men) <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed. Prov. 13. 20. Be not among wine-bibbers. Prov.</hi> 23. 20. Come not near the door of an Harlot, or Harlots houſe. <hi>Prov. 5. 8. Bleſſed is the man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 1. This is the firſt part of my Advice, which is the ſame you are engaged to by the Vow of your Baptiſm, wherein you renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, and are under a ſolemn obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to maintain a continual War againſt them, as being enemies to your Soul. And if you ſhall neglect to do it, you would be a forſworn creature. This is a conſideration well worthy your laying to heart. In the next place, you muſt carefully uſe thoſe means that God hath appointed to work grace and holineſs in your heart; for by this we are ſaved. <hi>And without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or be happy. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Let ſin be the grief and burden of your heart; yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſin original chiefly, as well as actual ſins; for we are all born in ſin, and Children of wrath by Nature; and muſt be born again; that ſo Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Corruption, the plague of our heart, may be healed in us by a new birth from Heaven. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> For this you muſt pray to God earneſtly, and with importunity; that he will create in you a new heart; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 10. and work in you a lively Faith, that you may kiſs the Son, believe in Jeſus. Chriſt for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin and Salvation. For this end you muſt diligently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attend on the Word, which is the ordinary means which God hath appointed to beget and increaſe Faith. <hi>Rom. 10. 17. Faith cometh by hearing.</hi> Have a care to keep holy the Sabbath day conſtantly; and no day neglect reading the Scripture: And let fervent Prayer be your
